<P>(ii) <I>Reason for detainment or internment.</I> The reason for which a serviceperson was detained or interned is immaterial in determining POW status, except that a serviceperson who is detained or interned by a foreign government for an alleged violation of its laws is not entitled to be considered a former POW on the basis of that period of detention or internment, unless the charges are a sham intended to legitimize the period of detention or internment.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Central Office approval.</I> The Director of the Compensation Service, VA Central Office, shall approve all VA regional office determinations establishing or denying POW status, with the exception of those service department determinations accepted under paragraph (y)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>In line of duty.</I> The Department of Veterans Affairs shall consider that a serviceperson was forcibly detained or interned in line of duty unless the evidence of record discloses that forcible detainment or internment was the proximate result of the serviceperson's own willful misconduct.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.10 Dependency and indemnity compensation rate for a surviving spouse.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General determination of rate.</I> When VA grants a surviving spouse entitlement to DIC, VA will determine the rate of the benefit it will award. The rate of the benefit will be the total of the basic monthly rate specified in paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and any applicable increases specified in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Basic monthly rate.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the basic monthly rate of DIC for a surviving spouse will be the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(1).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Section 1311(a)(2) increase.</I> The basic monthly rate under paragraph (b) of this section shall be increased by the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(2) if the veteran, at the time of death, was receiving, or was entitled to receive, compensation for service-connected disability that was rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. Determinations of entitlement to this increase shall be made in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Alternative basic monthly rate for death occurring prior to January 1, 1993.</I> The basic monthly rate of DIC for a surviving spouse when the death of the veteran occurred prior to January 1, 1993, will be the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3) corresponding to the veteran's pay grade in service, but only if such rate is greater than the total of the basic monthly rate and the section 1311(a)(2) increase (if applicable) the surviving spouse is entitled to receive under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The Secretary of the concerned service department will certify the veteran's pay grade and the certification will be binding on VA. DIC paid pursuant to this paragraph may not be increased by the section 1311(a)(2) increase under paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Additional increases.</I> One or more of the following increases may be paid in addition to the basic monthly rate and the section 1311(a)(2) increase.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Increase for children.</I> If the surviving spouse has one or more children under the age of 18 of the deceased veteran (including a child not in the surviving spouse's actual or constructive custody, or a child who is in active military service), the monthly DIC rate will be increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(b) for each child.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Increase for regular aid and attendance.</I> If the surviving spouse is determined to be in need of regular aid and attendance under the criteria in &#xA7; 3.352 or is a patient in a nursing home, the monthly DIC rate will be increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(c).
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Increase for housebound status.</I> If the surviving spouse does not qualify for the regular aid and attendance allowance but is housebound under the criteria in &#xA7; 3.351(e), the monthly DIC rate will be increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(d).
</P>
<P>(4) For a two-year period beginning on the date entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation commenced, the dependency and indemnity compensation paid monthly to a surviving spouse with one or more children below the age of 18 shall be increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(f), regardless of the number of such children. The dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this paragraph is in addition to any other dependency and indemnity compensation payable. The increase in dependency and indemnity compensation of a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall cease beginning with the first month commencing after the month in which all children of the surviving spouse have attained the age of 18.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Criteria governing section 1311(a)(2) increase.</I> In determining whether a surviving spouse qualifies for the section 1311(a)(2) increase under paragraph (c) of this section, the following standards shall apply.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Marriage requirement.</I> The surviving spouse must have been married to the veteran for the entire eight-year period referenced in paragraph (c) of this section in order to qualify for the section 1311(a)(2) increase.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Determination of total disability.</I> As used in paragraph (c) of this section, the phrase &#x201C;rated by VA as totally disabling&#x201D; includes total disability ratings based on unemployability (&#xA7; 4.16 of this chapter).
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Definition of &#x201C;entitled to receive&#x201D;.</I> As used in paragraph (c) of this section, the phrase &#x201C;entitled to receive&#x201D; means that the veteran filed a claim for disability compensation during his or her lifetime and one of the following circumstances is satisfied:
</P>
<P>(i) The veteran would have received total disability compensation for the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section but for clear and unmistakable error committed by VA in a decision on a claim filed during the veteran's lifetime; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Additional evidence submitted to VA before or after the veteran's death, consisting solely of service department records that existed at the time of a prior VA decision but were not previously considered by VA, provides a basis for reopening a claim finally decided during the veteran's lifetime and for awarding a total service-connected disability rating retroactively in accordance with &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.156(c) and 3.400(q)(2) of this part for the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section; or
</P>
<P>(iii) At the time of death, the veteran had a service-connected disability that was continuously rated totally disabling by VA for the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, but was not receiving compensation because:
</P>
<P>(A) VA was paying the compensation to the veteran's dependents;
</P>
<P>(B) VA was withholding the compensation under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 5314 to offset an indebtedness of the veteran;
</P>
<P>(C) The veteran had not waived retired or retirement pay in order to receive compensation;
</P>
<P>(D) VA was withholding payments under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1174(h)(2);
</P>
<P>(E) VA was withholding payments because the veteran's whereabouts were unknown, but the veteran was otherwise entitled to continued payments based on a total service-connected disability rating; or
</P>
<P>(F) VA was withholding payments under 38 U.S.C. 5308 but determines that benefits were payable under 38 U.S.C. 5309.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.12 Character of discharge.</HEAD>
<P>(a) If the former service member did not die in service, pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation is not payable unless the period of service on which the claim is based was terminated by discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable. (38 U.S.C. 101(2)). A discharge under honorable conditions is binding on the Department of Veterans Affairs as to character of discharge.
</P>
<P>(b) A discharge or release from service under one of the conditions specified in this section is a bar to the payment of benefits unless it is found that the person was insane at the time of committing the offense causing such discharge or release or unless otherwise specifically provided (38 U.S.C. 5303(b)).
</P>
<P>(c) Benefits are not payable where the former service member was discharged or released under one of the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) As a conscientious objector who refused to perform military duty, wear the uniform, or comply with lawful order of competent military authorities.
</P>
<P>(2) By reason of the sentence of a general court-martial.
</P>
<P>(3) Resignation by an officer for the good of the service.
</P>
<P>(4) As a deserter.
</P>
<P>(5) As an alien during a period of hostilities, where it is affirmatively shown that the former service member requested his or her release. See &#xA7; 3.7(b).
</P>
<P>(6) By reason of a discharge under other than honorable conditions issued as a result of an absence without official leave (AWOL) for a continuous period of at least 180 days. This bar to benefit entitlement does not apply if there are compelling circumstances to warrant the prolonged unauthorized absence. This bar applies to any person awarded an honorable or general discharge prior to October 8, 1977, under one of the programs listed in paragraph (h) of this section, and to any person who prior to October 8, 1977, had not otherwise established basic eligibility to receive Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. The term <I>established basic eligibility to receive Department of Veterans Affairs benefits</I> means either a Department of Veterans Affairs determination that an other than honorable discharge was issued under conditions other than dishonorable, or an upgraded honorable or general discharge issued prior to October 8, 1977, under criteria other than those prescribed by one of the programs listed in paragraph (h) of this section. However, if a person was discharged or released by reason of the sentence of a general court-martial, only a finding of insanity (paragraph (b) of this section) or a decision of a board of correction of records established under 10 U.S.C. 1552 can estalish basic eligibility to receive Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. The following factors will be considered in determining whether there are compelling circumstances to warrant the prolonged unauthorized absence.
</P>
<P>(i) Length and character of service exclusive of the period of prolonged AWOL. Service exclusive of the period of prolonged AWOL should generally be of such quality and length that it can be characterized as honest, faithful and meritorious and of benefit to the Nation.
</P>
<P>(ii) Reasons for going AWOL. Reasons which are entitled to be given consideration when offered by the claimant include family emergencies or obligations, or similar types of obligations or duties owed to third parties. The reasons for going AWOL should be evaluated in terms of the person's age, cultural background, educational level and judgmental maturity. Consideration should be given to how the situation appeared to the person himself or herself, and not how the adjudicator might have reacted. Hardship or suffering incurred during overseas service, or as a result of combat wounds of other service-incurred or aggravated disability, is to be carefully and sympathetically considered in evaluating the person's state of mind at the time the prolonged AWOL period began.
</P>
<P>(iii) A valid legal defense exists for the absence which would have precluded a conviction for AWOL. Compelling circumstances could occur as a matter of law if the absence could not validly be charged as, or lead to a conviction of, an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For purposes of this paragraph the defense must go directly to the substantive issue of absence rather than to procedures, technicalities or formalities.
</P>
<P>(d) A discharge or release because of one of the offenses specified in this paragraph is considered to have been issued under dishonorable conditions.
</P>
<P>(1) Acceptance of an undesirable discharge to escape trial by general court-martial.
</P>
<P>(2) Mutiny or spying.
</P>
<P>(3) An offense involving moral turpitude. This includes, generally, conviction of a felony.
</P>
<P>(4) Willful and persistent misconduct. This includes a discharge under other than honorable conditions, if it is determined that it was issued because of willful and persistent misconduct. A discharge because of a minor offense will not, however, be considered willful and persistent misconduct if service was otherwise honest, faithful and meritorious.
</P>
<P>(5) Homosexual acts involving aggravating circumstances or other factors affecting the performance of duty. Examples of homosexual acts involving aggravating circumstances or other factors affecting the performance of duty include child molestation, homosexual prostitution, homosexual acts or conduct accompanied by assault or coercion, and homosexual acts or conduct taking place between service members of disparate rank, grade, or status when a service member has taken advantage of his or her superior rank, grade, or status.
</P>
<P>(e) An honorable discharge or discharge under honorable conditions issued through a board for correction of records established under authority of 10 U.S.C. 1552 is final and conclusive on the Department of Veterans Affairs. The action of the board sets aside any prior bar to benefits imposed under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(f) An honorable or general discharge issued prior to October 8, 1977, under authority other than that listed in paragraphs (h) (1), (2) and (3) of this section by a discharge review board established under 10 U.S.C. 1553 set aside any bar to benefits imposed under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section except the bar contained in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(g) An honorable or general discharge issued on or after October 8, 1977, by a discharge review board established under 10 U.S.C. 1553, sets aside a bar to benefits imposed under paragraph (d), but not paragraph (c), of this section provided that:
</P>
<P>(1) The discharge is upgraded as a result of an individual case review;
</P>
<P>(2) The discharge is upgraded under uniform published standards and procedures that generally apply to all persons administratively discharged or released from active military, naval, air, or space service under conditions other than honorable; and
</P>
<P>(3) Such standards are consistent with historical standards for determining honorable service and do not contain any provision for automatically granting or denying an upgraded discharge.
</P>
<P>(h) Unless a discharge review board established under 10 U.S.C. 1553 determines on an individual case basis that the discharge would be upgraded under uniform standards meeting the requirements set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, an honorable or general discharge awarded under one of the following programs does not remove any bar to benefits imposed under this section:
</P>
<P>(1) The President's directive of January 19, 1977, implementing Presidential Proclamation 4313 of September 16, 1974; or
</P>
<P>(2) The Department of Defense's special discharge review program effective April 5, 1977; or
</P>
<P>(3) Any discharge review program implemented after April 5, 1977, that does not apply to all persons administratively discharged or released from active military service under other than honorable conditions.

<P>(i) No overpayments shall be created as a result of payments made after October 8, 1977, based on an upgraded honorable or general discharge issued under one of the programs listed in paragraph (h) of this section which would not be awarded under the standards set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Accounts in payment status on or after October 8, 1977, shall be terminated the end of the month in which it is determined that the original other than honorable discharge was not issued under conditions other than dishonorable following notice from the appropriate discharge review board that the discharge would not have been upgraded under the standards set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest. Accounts in suspense (either before or after October 8, 1977) shall be terminated on the date of last payment or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest.
</P>
<P>(j) No overpayment shall be created as a result of payments made after October 8, 1977, in cases in which the bar contained in paragraph (c)(6) of this section is for application. Accounts in payment status on or after October 8, 1977, shall be terminated at the end of the month in which it is determined that compelling circumstances do not exist, or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest.

In such cases conditions of discharge will be determined by the VA as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Entry level separation.</I> Uncharacterized administrative separations of this type shall be considered under conditions other than dishonorable.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Void enlistment or induction.</I> Uncharacterized administrative separations of this type shall be reviewed based on facts and circumstances surrounding separation, with reference to the provisions of &#xA7; 3.14 of this part, to determine whether separation was under conditions other than dishonorable.

</P>
<P>(1) World War I; prior to November 11, 1918. As to reenlistments, this subparagraph applies only to Army and National Guard. No involuntary extension or other restrictions existed on Navy enlistments.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.14 Validity of enlistments.</HEAD>
<P>Service is valid unless the enlistment is voided by the service department.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Enlistment not prohibited by statute.</I> Where an enlistment is voided by the service department for reasons other than those stated in paragraph (b) of this section, service is valid from the date of entry upon active duty to the date of voidance by the service department. Benefits may not be paid, however, unless the discharge is held to have been under conditions other than dishonorable. Generally discharge for concealment of a physical or mental defect except incompetency or insanity which would have prevented enlistment will be held to be under dishonorable conditions.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Statutory prohibition.</I> Where an enlistment is voided by the service department because the person did not have legal capacity to contract for a reason other than minority (as in the case of an insane person) or because the enlistment was prohibited by statute (a deserter or person convicted of a felony), benefits may not be paid based on that service even though a disability was incurred during such service. An undesirable discharge by reason of the fraudulent enlistment voids the enlistment from the beginning.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Misrepresentation of age.</I> Active service which was terminated because of concealment of minority or misrepresentation of age is honorable if the veteran was released from service under conditions other than dishonorable. Service is valid from the date of entry upon active duty to the date of discharge.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Honorable discharges.</I> Determinations as to honorable service will be made by the service departments and the finding shall be binding on the Department of Veterans Affairs, but, in the case of an alien, the effect of the discharge will be governed by &#xA7; 3.7(b).

</P>
<P>(1) The veteran's death was not the result of his or her own willful misconduct, and
</P>
<P>(2) At the time of death, the veteran was receiving, or was entitled to receive, compensation for service-connected disability that was:
</P>
<P>(i) Rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately preceding death;
</P>
<P>(ii) Rated by VA as totally disabling continuously since the veteran's release from active duty and for at least 5 years immediately preceding death; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of not less than one year immediately preceding death, if the veteran was a former prisoner of war.

<P>(b) For purposes of this section, &#x201C;entitled to receive&#x201D; means that the veteran filed a claim for disability compensation during his or her lifetime and one of the following circumstances is satisfied:
</P>
<P>(1) The veteran would have received total disability compensation at the time of death for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling for the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section but for clear and unmistakable error committed by VA in a decision on a claim filed during the veteran's lifetime; or
</P>
<P>(2) Additional evidence submitted to VA before or after the veteran's death, consisting solely of service department records that existed at the time of a prior VA decision but were not previously considered by VA, provides a basis for reopening a claim finally decided during the veteran's lifetime and for awarding a total service-connected disability rating retroactively in accordance with &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.156(c) and 3.400(q)(2) of this part for the relevant period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or
</P>
<P>(3) At the time of death, the veteran had a service-connected disability that was continuously rated totally disabling by VA for the period specified in paragraph (a)(2), but was not receiving compensation because:
</P>
<P>(i) VA was paying the compensation to the veteran's dependents;
</P>
<P>(ii) VA was withholding the compensation under authority of 38 U.S.C. 5314 to offset an indebtedness of the veteran;
</P>
<P>(iii) The veteran had not waived retired or retirement pay in order to receive compensation;
</P>
<P>(iv) VA was withholding payments under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1174(h)(2);
</P>
<P>(v) VA was withholding payments because the veteran's whereabouts were unknown, but the veteran was otherwise entitled to continued payments based on a total service-connected disability rating; or
</P>
<P>(vi) VA was withholding payments under 38 U.S.C. 5308 but determines that benefits were payable under 38 U.S.C. 5309.
</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of this section, &#x201C;rated by VA as totally disabling&#x201D; includes total disability ratings based on unemployability (&#xA7; 4.16 of this chapter).
</P>
<P>(d) To be entitled to benefits under this section, a surviving spouse must have been married to the veteran&#x2014;
</P>

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.24 Improved pension rates&#x2014;Surviving children.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The provisions of this section apply to children of a deceased veteran not in the custody of a surviving spouse who has basic eligibility to receive improved pension. Children in custody of a surviving spouse who has basic eligibility to receive improved pension do not have separate entitlement. Basic eligibility to receive improved pension means that the surviving spouse is in receipt of improved pension or could become entitled to receive improved pension except for the amount of the surviving spouse's countable annual income or the size of the surviving spouse's estate (See &#xA7; 3.274(c)). Under &#xA7; 3.23(d)(5) the countable annual income of a surviving spouse includes the countable annual income of each child of the veteran in custody of the surviving spouse to the extent the child's income is reasonably available to or for the surviving spouse, unless in the judgment of the Department of Veterans Affairs to do so would work a hardship on the surviving spouse.

<P>(b) <I>Child with no personal custodian or in the custody of an institution.</I> In cases in which there is no personal custodian, <I>i.e.</I>, there is no person who has the legal right to exercise parental control and responsibility for the child's welfare (See &#xA7; 3.57(d)), or the child is in the custody of an institution, pension shall be paid to the child at the annual rate specified in 38 U.S.C. 1542, as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced by the amount of the child's countable annual income.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.25 Parent's dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC)&#x2014;Method of payment computation.</HEAD>
<P>Monthly payments of parents' DIC shall be computed in accordance with the following formulas:
</P>
<P>(a) <I>One parent.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if there is only one parent, the monthly rate specified in 38 U.S.C 1315(b)(1), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced by $.08 for each dollar of such parent's countable annual income in excess of $800. No payments of DIC may be made under this paragraph, however, if such parent's countable annual income exceeds the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1315(b)(3), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, and no payment of DIC to a parent under this paragraph may be less than $5 a month.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>One parent who has remarried.</I> If there is only one parent and the parent has remarried and is living with the parent's spouse, DIC shall be paid under paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of this section, whichever shall result in the greater benefit being paid to the veteran's parent. In the case of remarriage, the total combined annual income of the parent and the parent's spouse shall be counted in determining the monthly rate of DIC.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Two parents not living together.</I> The rate computation method in this paragraph applies to:
</P>
<P>(1) Two parents who are not living together, or
</P>
<P>(2) An unremarried parent when both parents are living and the other parent has remarried.
</P>
<FP>The monthly rate of DIC paid to such parent shall be the rate specified in 38 U.S.C. 1315(c)(1), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced by an amount no greater than $.08 for each dollar of such parent's countable annual income in excess of $800, except that no payments of DIC may be made under this paragraph if such parent's countable annual income exceeds the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1315(c)(3), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, and no payment of DIC to a parent under this paragraph may be less than $5 monthly. Each time there is a rate increase under 38 U.S.C. 5312, the amount of the reduction under this paragraph shall be recomputed to provide, as nearly as possible, for an equitable distribution of the rate increase. The results of this computation method shall be published in schedular format in the &#x201C;Notices&#x201D; section of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
</FP>
<P>(d) <I>Two parents living together or remarried parents living with spouse.</I> The rate computation method in this paragraph applies to each parent living with another parent and to each remarried parent when both parents are alive. The monthly rate of DIC paid to such parents shall be the rate specified in 38 U.S.C. 1315(d)(1), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced to an amount no greater than $.08 for each dollar of such parent's and spouse's combined countable annual income in excess of $1,000 except that no payments of DIC to a parent under this paragraph may be less than $5 monthly. Each time there is a rate increase under 38 U.S.C. 5312, the amount of the reduction under this paragraph shall be recomputed to provide, as nearly as possible, for an equitable distribution of the rate increase.

</P>
<P>(c) <I>Specific exclusions.</I> The provisions of this section do not apply to the following types of awards.
</P>
<P>(1) Surviving spouse's rate for the month of a veteran's death (for exception see &#xA7; 3.20(b))
</P>
<P>(2) In cases where military retired or retirement pay is greater than the amount of compensation payable, compensation will be paid as of the effective date of waiver of such pay. However, in cases where the amount of compensation payable is greater than military retired or retirement pay, payment of the available difference for any period prior to the effective date of total waiver of such pay is subject to the general provisions of this section.

<P>(a) For a Regular Philippine Scout or a member of one of the regular components of the Philippine Commonwealth Army while serving with Armed Forces of United States, the period of active service will be from the date certified by the Armed Forces as the date of enlistment or date of report for active duty whichever is later to date of release from active duty, discharge, death, or in the case of a member of the Philippine Commonwealth Army June 30, 1946, whichever was earlier.

<P>(4) <I>Lawfully admitted for permanent residence</I> means that an individual has been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the U.S. as an immigrant by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under title 8, United States Code, and still has this status.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Eligibility requirements.</I> Compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation is payable at the full-dollar rate, based on service described in &#xA7; 3.40(b), (c), or (d), to a veteran or a veteran's survivor who is residing in the U.S. and is either:
</P>
<P>(1) A citizen of the U.S., or
</P>
<P>(2) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Evidence of eligibility.</I> (1) A valid original or copy of one of the following documents is required to prove that the veteran or the veteran's survivor is a natural born citizen of the U.S.:
</P>
<P>(i) A valid U.S. passport;
</P>
<P>(ii) A birth certificate showing that he or she was born in the U.S.; or
</P>
<P>(iii) A Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the U.S. issued by a U.S. consulate abroad.
</P>
<P>(2) Only verification by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to VA that a veteran or a veteran's survivor is a naturalized citizen of the U.S., or a valid U.S. passport, will be sufficient proof of such status.
</P>
<P>(3) Only verification by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to VA that a veteran or a veteran's survivor is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. will be sufficient proof of such status.
</P>
<P>(4) VA will not pay benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section unless the evidence establishes that the veteran or survivor is lawfully residing in the U.S.
</P>
<P>(i) Such evidence should identify the veteran's or survivor's name and relevant dates, and may include:
</P>
<P>(A) A valid driver's license issued by the state of residence;
</P>
<P>(B) Employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2 forms, and certification of the filing of Federal, State, or local income tax returns;

<P>(C) Residential leases, rent receipts, utility bills and receipts, or other relevant documents showing dates of utility service at a leased residence;
</P>
<P>(D) Hospital or medical records showing medical treatment or hospitalization, and showing the name of the medical facility or treating physician;

<P>(E) Property tax bills and receipts; and
</P>
<P>(F) School records.
</P>

</P>
<P>(d) <I>Continued eligibility.</I> (1) In order to continue receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section, a veteran or a veteran's survivor must be physically present in the U.S. for at least 183 days of each calendar year in which he or she receives payments at the full-dollar rate, and may not be absent from the U.S. for more than 60 consecutive days at a time unless good cause is shown. However, if a veteran or a veteran's survivor becomes eligible for full-dollar rate benefits for the first time on or after July 1 of any calendar year, the 183-day rule will not apply during that calendar year. VA will not consider a veteran or a veteran's survivor to have been absent from the U.S. if he or she left and returned to the U.S. on the same date.
</P>
<P>(2) A veteran or a veteran's survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must notify VA within 30 days of leaving the U.S., or within 30 days of losing either his or her U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident alien status. When a veteran or a veteran's survivor no longer meets the eligibility requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, VA will reduce his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under the law, effective on the date determined under &#xA7; 3.505. If such veteran or survivor regains his or her U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident alien status, VA will restore full-dollar rate benefits, effective the date the veteran or survivor meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) When requested to do so by VA, a veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must verify that he or she continues to meet the residency and citizenship or permanent resident alien status requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. VA will advise the veteran or survivor at the time of the request that the verification must be furnished within 60 days and that failure to do so will result in the reduction of benefits. If the veteran or survivor fails to furnish the evidence within 60 days, VA will reduce his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized, as provided in &#xA7; 3.652.
</P>
<P>(4) A veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must promptly notify VA of any change in his or her address. If mail from VA to the veteran or survivor is returned to VA by the U.S. Postal Service, VA will make reasonable efforts to determine the correct mailing address. If VA is unable to determine the correct mailing address through reasonable efforts, VA will reduce benefit payments to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under law, effective on the date determined under &#xA7; 3.505.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Effective date for restored eligibility.</I> In the case of a veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate, if VA reduces his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under the law, VA will resume payments at the full-dollar rate, if otherwise in order, effective the first day of the month following the date on which he or she again meets the requirements. However, such increased payments will be retroactive no more than one year prior to the date on which VA receives evidence that he or she again meets the requirements.

<P>(d) Definition of <I>child custody.</I> The provisions of this paragraph are for the purpose of determining entitlement to improved pension under &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.23 and 3.24.
</P>
<P>(1) Custody of a child shall be considered to rest with a veteran, surviving spouse of a veteran or person legally responsible for the child's support if that person has the legal right to exercise parental control and responsibility for the welfare and care of the child. A child of the veteran residing with the veteran, surviving spouse of the veteran who is the child's natural or adoptive parent, or person legally responsible for the child's support shall be presumed to be in the custody of that individual. Where the veteran, surviving spouse, or person legally responsible for the child's support has not been divested of legal custody, but the child is not residing with that individual, the child shall be considered in the custody of the individual for purposes of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.
</P>
<P>(2) The term <I>person legally responsible for the child's support</I> means a person who is under a legally imposed obligation (e.g., by statute or court order) to provide for the child's support, as well as a natural or adoptive parent who has not been divested of legal custody. If the child's natural or adoptive parent has remarried, the stepparent may also be considered a person legally responsible for the child's support. A child shall be considered in the joint custody of his or her stepparent and natural or adoptive parent so long as the natural or adoptive parent and the stepparent are not estranged and residing apart, and the natural or adoptive parent has not been divested of legal custody. When a child is in such joint custody the combined income of the natural or adoptive parent and the stepparent shall be included as income of the person legally responsible for support under &#xA7; 3.24(c).
</P>
<P>(3) A person having custody of a child prior to the time the child attains age 18 shall be considered to retain custody of the child for periods on and after the child's 18th birthday, unless the person is divested of legal custody. This applies without regard to when a child reaches the age of majority under applicable State law. This also applies without regard to whether the child was entitled to pension prior to age 18, or whether increased pension was payable to a veteran or surviving spouse on behalf of the child prior to the child's 18th birthday. If the child's custodian dies after the child has attained age 18, the child shall be considered to be in custody of a successor custodian provided the successor custodian has the right to exercise parental control and responsibility for the welfare and care of the child.

<P>(e) <I>Child adopted under foreign law</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to a person adopted under the laws of any jurisdiction other than a State. The term <I>State</I> is defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(20) and also includes the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The term <I>veteran</I> includes, for the purposes of this paragraph, a Commonwealth Army veteran or new Philippine Scout as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3566.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Adopted child of living veteran.</I> A person residing outside any of the States shall not be considered to be a legally adopted child of a veteran during the lifetime of the veteran unless all of the following conditions are met.
</P>
<P>(i) The person was less than 18 years of age at the time of adoption.
</P>
<P>(ii) The person is receiving one-half or more of the person's support from the veteran.
</P>
<P>(iii) The person is not in the custody of the person's natural parent unless the natural parent is the veteran's spouse.
</P>
<P>(iv) The person is residing with the veteran (or in the case of divorce following adoption, with the divorced spouse who is also a natural or adoptive parent) except for periods during which the person is residing apart from the veteran for purposes of full-time attendance at an educational institution or during which the person or the veteran is confined in a hospital, nursing home, other health-care facility, or other institution.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Adopted child of deceased veteran.</I> A person shall not be considered to have been a legally adopted child of a veteran as of the date of the veteran's death and thereafter unless one of the following conditions is met.
</P>
<P>(i) The veteran was entitled to and was receiving for the person a dependent's allowance or similar monetary benefit payable under title 38, United States Code at any time within the 1-year period immediately preceding the veteran's death; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The person met the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section for a period of at least 1 year prior to the veteran's death.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Verification.</I> In the case of an adopted child of a living veteran, the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section are for prospective application. That is, in addition to meeting all of the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section at the time of initial adjudication, benefits are not payable thereafter for or to a child adopted under the laws of any jurisdiction other than a State unless the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section continue to be met. Consequently, whenever Department of Veterans Affairs benefits are payable to or for a child adopted under the laws of any jurisdiction other than a State, and the veteran who adopted the child is living, the beneficiary shall submit, upon Department of Veterans Affairs request, a report, or other evidence, to determine if the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section were met for any period for which payment was made for or to the child and whether such requirements will continue to be met for future entitlement periods. Failure to submit the requested report or evidence within a reasonable time from date of request may result in termination of benefits payable for or to the child.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.102 Reasonable doubt.</HEAD>
<P>It is the defined and consistently applied policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. By reasonable doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim. It is a substantial doubt and one within the range of probability as distinguished from pure speculation or remote possibility. It is not a means of reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence. Mere suspicion or doubt as to the truth of any statements submitted, as distinguished from impeachment or contradiction by evidence or known facts, is not justifiable basis for denying the application of the reasonable doubt doctrine if the entire, complete record otherwise warrants invoking this doctrine. The reasonable doubt doctrine is also applicable even in the absence of official records, particularly if the basic incident allegedly arose under combat, or similarly strenuous conditions, and is consistent with the probable results of such known hardships.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.103 Procedural due process and other rights.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Statement of policy.</I> Every claimant has the right to written notice of the decision made on his or her claim, the right to a hearing, and the right of representation. Proceedings before VA are ex parte in nature, and it is the obligation of VA to assist a claimant in developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to render a decision which grants every benefit that can be supported in law while protecting the interests of the Government. The provisions of this section apply to all claims for benefits and relief, and decisions thereon, within the purview of this part 3.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>The right to notice</I>&#x2014; </P>
<P>(1) <I>General.</I> Claimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief. Such notice will clearly set forth the elements described under paragraph (f) of this section, the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the right of representation, and the right, as well as the necessary procedures and time limits to initiate a higher-level review, supplemental claim, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Advance notice and opportunity for hearing.</I> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, no award of compensation, pension or dependency and indemnity compensation shall be terminated, reduced or otherwise adversely affected unless the beneficiary has been notified of such adverse action and has been provided a period of 60 days in which to submit evidence for the purpose of showing that the adverse action should not be taken.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Exceptions.</I> In lieu of advance notice and opportunity for a hearing, VA will send a written notice to the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary at the same time it takes an adverse action under the following circumstances:
</P>
<P>(i) An adverse action based solely on factual and unambiguous information or statements as to income, net worth, or dependency or marital status that the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary provided to VA in writing or orally (under the procedures set forth in &#xA7; 3.217(b)), with knowledge or notice that such information would be used to calculate benefit amounts.
</P>
<P>(ii) An adverse action based upon the beneficiary's or fiduciary's failure to return a required eligibility verification report.
</P>
<P>(iii) Evidence reasonably indicates that a beneficiary is deceased. However, in the event that VA has received a death certificate, a terminal hospital report verifying the death of a beneficiary or a claim for VA burial benefits, no notice of termination (contemporaneous or otherwise) will be required.
</P>
<P>(iv) An adverse action based upon a written and signed statement provided by the beneficiary to VA renouncing VA benefits (see &#xA7; 3.106 on renouncement).
</P>
<P>(v) An adverse action based upon a written or electronic statement provided to VA by a veteran that indicates that the veteran has received, is in receipt of, or will receive active service pay as defined by &#xA7; 3.654(a), or, in the case of compensation, written or electronic notice from the Department of Defense that indicates that the veteran has received or is in receipt of active service pay as defined by &#xA7; 3.654(a), provided that, in cases involving notice from the Department of Defense, the veteran has on a previous occasion of concurrent receipt of compensation and payment for the type of service at issue received the notice described in paragraph (b)(2), but with a period of 30 rather than 60 days to respond, as well as notice that suspension of compensation payments based on subsequent payments for the same type of service will be made without additional advance notice. The statement from the veteran or notice from the Department of Defense must include the date on which the service resulting in receipt of active service pay began or, in the case of a statement from the veteran, the date on which the service resulting in receipt of active service pay is expected to begin, or, in the case of training duty, the number of training days performed, or, in the case of a statement from the veteran, the number of training days expected to be performed, during a specified period of time (<I>e.g.,</I> last month, last quarter, last year, next month, etc.). In order for this paragraph to apply, the veteran must have received prior notice that receipt of active service pay precludes concurrent receipt of VA benefits, or VA must have received a statement from the veteran that indicates knowledge of such preclusion. In cases to which &#xA7; 3.700(a)(1)(iii) of this part applies, the Veteran must also have waived VA benefits. When notice provided by the Department of Defense contains information indicating that the monthly level of disability compensation for a veteran exceeds the veteran's monthly active service pay rate, the exception contained in this paragraph will only apply to a written or electronic statement provided to VA by the veteran.
</P>
<P>(vi) An adverse action based upon a garnishment order issued under 42 U.S.C. 659(a).
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(4) <I>Restoration of benefits.</I> VA will restore retroactively benefits that were reduced, terminated, or otherwise adversely affected based on oral information or statements if within 30 days of the date on which VA issues the notification of adverse action the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary asserts that the adverse action was based upon information or statements that were inaccurate or upon information that was not provided by the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary. This will not preclude VA from taking subsequent action that adversely affects benefits.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Submission of evidence</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General rule.</I> VA will include in the record, any evidence whether documentary, testimonial, or in other form, submitted by the claimant in support of a pending claim and any issue, contention, or argument a claimant may offer with respect to a claim, except as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and &#xA7; 3.2601(f).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Treatment of evidence received after notice of a decision.</I> The evidentiary record for a claim before the agency of original jurisdiction closes when VA issues notice of a decision on the claim. The agency of original jurisdiction will not consider, or take any other action on evidence that is submitted by a claimant, associated with the claims file, or constructively received by VA as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, after notice of decision on a claim, and such evidence will not be considered part of the record at the time of any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, except as described in &#xA7; 3.156(c) and under the following circumstances:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Receipt of a complete claim.</I> The agency of original jurisdiction subsequently receives a complete application for a supplemental claim or initial claim; or
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Board and higher-level review returns.</I> A claim is pending readjudication after identification of a duty to assist error (which includes an error resulting from constructive receipt of evidence prior to the notice of decision), during a higher-level review or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Those events reopen the record and any evidence previously submitted to the agency of original jurisdiction or associated with the claims file while the record was closed will become part of the evidentiary record to be considered upon readjudication.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Constructive receipt of VA treatment records.</I> Records within the actual custody of the Veterans Health Administration are deemed constructively received by the Veterans Benefits Administration at the time when the Veterans Benefits Administration had knowledge of the existence of said records through information furnished by the claimant sufficient to locate those records (see 38 U.S.C. 5103A(c)).
</P>
<P>(d) <I>The right to a hearing.</I> (1) Upon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim within the purview of part 3 of this chapter before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim. A hearing is not available in connection with a request for higher-level review under &#xA7; 3.2601. VA will provide the place of hearing in the VA field office having original jurisdiction over the claim, or at the VA office nearest the claimant's home having adjudicative functions, or videoconference capabilities, or, subject to available resources and solely at the option of VA, at any other VA facility or federal building at which suitable hearing facilities are available. VA will provide one or more employees who have original determinative authority of such issues to conduct the hearing and be responsible for establishment and preservation of the hearing record. Upon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing in connection with proposed adverse actions before one or more VA employees having original determinative authority who did not participate in the proposed action. All expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with the hearing are the responsibility of the claimant.
</P>
<P>(2) The purpose of a hearing is to permit the claimant to introduce into the record, in person, any available evidence which he or she considers relevant and any arguments or contentions with respect to the facts and applicable law which he or she may consider pertinent. All testimony will be under oath or affirmation. The claimant is entitled to produce witnesses, but the claimant and witnesses must be present. The agency of original jurisdiction will not normally schedule a hearing for the sole purpose of receiving argument from a representative. It is the responsibility of the VA employees conducting the hearings to explain fully the issues and suggest the submission of evidence which the claimant may have overlooked and which would be of advantage to the claimant's position. To assure clarity and completeness of the hearing record, questions which are directed to the claimant and to witnesses are to be framed to explore fully the basis for claimed entitlement rather than with an intent to refute evidence or to discredit testimony.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>The right to representation.</I> Subject to the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 14.626 through 14.637 of this title, claimants are entitled to representation of their choice at every stage in the prosecution of a claim.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Notification of decisions.</I> The claimant or beneficiary and his or her representative will be notified in writing of decisions affecting the payment of benefits or granting of relief. Written notification must include in the notice letter or enclosures or a combination thereof, all of the following elements:
</P>
<P>(1) Identification of the issues adjudicated;
</P>
<P>(2) A summary of the evidence considered;
</P>
<P>(3) A summary of the laws and regulations applicable to the claim;
</P>
<P>(4) A listing of any findings made by the adjudicator that are favorable to the claimant under &#xA7; 3.104(c);
</P>
<P>(5) For denied claims, identification of the element(s) required to grant the claim(s) that were not met;
</P>
<P>(6) If applicable, identification of the criteria required to grant service connection or the next higher-level of compensation;
</P>
<P>(7) An explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; and
</P>
<P>(8) A summary of the applicable review options under &#xA7; 3.2500 available for the claimant to seek further review of the decision.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.104 Binding nature of decisions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Binding decisions.</I> A decision of a VA rating agency is binding on all VA field offices as to conclusions based on the evidence on file at the time VA issues written notification in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5104. A binding agency decision is not subject to revision except by the Board of Veterans' Appeals, by Federal court order, or as provided in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.105, 3.2500, and 3.2600.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Binding administrative determinations.</I> Current determinations of line of duty, character of discharge, relationship, dependency, domestic relations questions, homicide, and findings of fact of death or presumptions of death made in accordance with existing instructions, and by application of the same criteria and based on the same facts, by either an Adjudication activity or an Insurance activity are binding one upon the other in the absence of clear and unmistakable error.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Favorable findings.</I> Any finding favorable to the claimant made by either a VA adjudicator, as described in &#xA7; 3.103(f)(4), or by the Board of Veterans' Appeals, as described in &#xA7; 20.801(a) of this chapter, is binding on all subsequent agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. For purposes of this section, a finding means a conclusion either on a question of fact or on an application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue(s) under review.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.105 Revision of decisions.</HEAD>
<P>The provisions of this section apply except where an award was based on an act of commission or omission by the payee, or with his or her knowledge (&#xA7; 3.500(b)); there is a change in law or a Department of Veterans Affairs issue, or a change in interpretation of law or a Department of Veterans Affairs issue (&#xA7; 3.114); or the evidence establishes that service connection was clearly illegal. The provisions with respect to the date of discontinuance of benefits are applicable to running awards. Where the award has been suspended, and it is determined that no additional payments are in order, the award will be discontinued effective date of last payment.
</P>
<P>(a)(1) <I>Error in final decisions.</I> Decisions are final when the underlying claim is finally adjudicated as provided in &#xA7; 3.160(d). Final decisions will be accepted by VA as correct with respect to the evidentiary record and the law that existed at the time of the decision, in the absence of clear and unmistakable error. At any time after a decision is final, the claimant may request, or VA may initiate, review of the decision to determine if there was a clear and unmistakable error in the decision. Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Definition of clear and unmistakable error.</I> A clear and unmistakable error is a very specific and rare kind of error. It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. If it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be clear and unmistakable. Generally, either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before VA, or the statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Effective date of reversed or revised decisions.</I> For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicative decision which constitutes a reversal or revision of a prior decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, where an award is reduced or discontinued because of administrative error or error in judgment, the provisions of &#xA7; 3.500(b)(2) will apply.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Record to be reviewed.</I> Review for clear and unmistakable error in a prior final decision of an agency of original jurisdiction must be based on the evidentiary record and the law that existed when that decision was made. The duty to assist in &#xA7; 3.159 does not apply to requests for revision based on clear and unmistakable error.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Change in interpretation.</I> Clear and unmistakable error does not include the otherwise correct application of a statute or regulation where, subsequent to the decision being challenged, there has been a change in the interpretation of the statute or regulation.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Limitation on Applicability.</I> Decisions of an agency of original jurisdiction on issues that have been decided on appeal by the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction are not subject to revision under this subsection.
</P>
<P>(vi) <I>Duty to assist not applicable.</I> For examples of situations that are not clear and unmistakable error see 38 CFR 20.1403(d).
</P>
<P>(vii) <I>Filing Requirements</I>&#x2014;(A) <I>General.</I> A request for revision of a decision based on clear and unmistakable error must be in writing, and must be signed by the requesting party or that party's authorized representative. The request must include the name of the claimant; the name of the requesting party if other than the claimant; the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and the date of the decision to which the request relates. If the applicable decision involved more than one issue, the request must identify the specific issue, or issues, to which the request pertains.
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Specific allegations required.</I> The request must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in the prior decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error. Non-specific allegations of failure to follow regulations or failure to give due process, or any other general, non-specific allegations of error, are insufficient to satisfy the requirement of the previous sentence.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Error in binding decisions prior to final adjudication.</I> Prior to the time that a claim is finally adjudicated, previous decisions which are binding will be accepted as correct by the agency of original jurisdiction, with respect to the evidentiary record and law existing at the time of the decision, unless the decision is clearly erroneous, after considering whether any favorable findings may be reversed as provided in &#xA7; 3.104(c).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Difference of opinion.</I> Whenever an adjudicative agency is of the opinion that a revision or an amendment of a previous decision is warranted on the basis of the evidentiary record and law that existed at the time of the decision, a difference of opinion being involved rather than a clear and unmistakable error, the proposed revision will be recommended to Central Office. However, a decision may be revised under &#xA7; 3.2600 or &#xA7; 3.2601 without being recommended to Central Office.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Character of discharge.</I> A determination as to character of discharge or line of duty which would result in discontinued entitlement is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Severance of service connection.</I> Subject to the limitations contained in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.114 and 3.957, service connection will be severed only where evidence establishes that it is clearly and unmistakably erroneous (the burden of proof being upon the Government). (Where service connection is severed because of a change in or interpretation of a law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue, the provisions of &#xA7; 3.114 are for application.) A change in diagnosis may be accepted as a basis for severance action if the examining physician or physicians or other proper medical authority certifies that, in the light of all accumulated evidence, the diagnosis on which service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous. This certification must be accompanied by a summary of the facts, findings, and reasons supporting the conclusion. When severance of service connection is considered warranted, a rating proposing severance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The claimant will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that service connection should be maintained. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued, if in order, effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires.

<P>(e) <I>Reduction in evaluation&#x2014;compensation.</I> Where the reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability or employability status is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires.

The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that pension benefits should be continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which the final rating action is approved.

Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if VA does not receive additional evidence within that period, it will take final rating action and reduce the award effective the last day of the month following 60 days from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the proposed reduction.

The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the benefits should be continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final adverse action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective as specified under the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.500 through 3.503 of this part.

<P>(i) <I>Predetermination hearings.</I> (1) In the advance written notice concerning proposed actions under paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, the beneficiary will be informed that he or she will have an opportunity for a predetermination hearing, provided that a request for such a hearing is received by VA within 30 days from the date of the notice. If a timely request is received, VA will notify the beneficiary in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least 10 days in advance of the scheduled hearing date. The 10 day advance notice may be waived by agreement between VA and the beneficiary or representative. The hearing will be conducted by VA personnel who did not participate in the proposed adverse action and who will bear the decision-making responsibility. If a predetermination hearing is timely requested, benefit payments shall be continued at the previously established level pending a final determination concerning the proposed action.
</P>
<P>(2) Following the predetermination procedures specified in this paragraph and paragraph (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of this section, whichever is applicable, final action will be taken. If a predetermination hearing was not requested or if the beneficiary failed without good cause to report for a scheduled predetermination hearing, the final action will be based solely upon the evidence of record. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant or beneficiary, death of an immediate family member, etc. If a predetermination hearing was conducted, the final action will be based on evidence and testimony adduced at the hearing as well as the other evidence of record including any additional evidence obtained following the hearing pursuant to necessary development. Whether or not a predetermination hearing was conducted, a written notice of the final action shall be issued to the beneficiary and his or her representative, setting forth the reasons therefor and the evidence upon which it is based.

</P>
<P>(i) Where reduction or discontinuance was proposed under the provisions of paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, the effective date of final action shall be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final action expires.

<P>(ii) Where reduction or discontinuance was proposed under the provisions of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, the effective date of final action shall be the last day of the month in which such action is approved.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.151 Claims for disability benefits.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. (38 U.S.C. 5101(a)). A claim by a veteran for compensation may be considered to be a claim for pension; and a claim by a veteran for pension may be considered to be a claim for compensation. The greater benefit will be awarded, unless the claimant specifically elects the lesser benefit. (See scope of claim, &#xA7; 3.155(d)(2); complete claim, &#xA7; 3.160(a); supplemental claims, &#xA7; 3.2501(b)).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Retroactive disability pension claims.</I> Where disability pension entitlement is established based on a claim received by VA on or after October 1, 1984, the pension award may not be effective prior to the date of receipt of the pension claim unless the veteran specifically claims entitlement to retroactive benefits. The claim for retroactivity may be filed separately or included in the claim for disability pension, but it must be received by VA within one year from the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled. Additional requirements for entitlement to a retroactive pension award are contained in &#xA7; 3.400(b) of this part.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Issues within a claim.</I> (1) To the extent that a complete claim application encompasses a request for more than one determination of entitlement, each specific entitlement will be adjudicated and is considered a separate issue for purposes of the review options prescribed in &#xA7; 3.2500. A single decision by an agency of original jurisdiction may adjudicate multiple issues in this respect, whether expressly claimed or determined by VA to be reasonably within the scope of the application as prescribed in &#xA7; 3.155(d)(2). VA will issue a decision that addresses each such identified issue within a claim. Upon receipt of notice of a decision, a claimant may elect any of the applicable review options prescribed in &#xA7; 3.2500 for each issue adjudicated.
</P>
<P>(2) With respect to service-connected disability compensation, an issue for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is defined as entitlement to compensation for a particular disability. For example, if a decision adjudicates service-connected disability compensation for both a knee condition and an ankle condition, compensation for each condition is a separate entitlement or issue for which a different review option may be elected. However, different review options may not be selected for specific components of the knee disability claim, such as ancillary benefits, whether a knee injury occurred in service, or whether a current knee condition resulted from a service-connected injury or condition.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Evidentiary record.</I> The evidentiary record before the agency of original jurisdiction for an initial or supplemental claim includes all evidence received by VA before VA issues notice of a decision on the claim. Once the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision on a claim, the evidentiary record closes as described in &#xA7; 3.103(c)(2) and VA no longer has a duty to assist in gathering evidence under &#xA7; 3.159. (See &#xA7; 3.155(b), submission of evidence).

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.155 How to file a claim.</HEAD>
<P>The following paragraphs describe the manner and methods in which a claim can be initiated and filed. The provisions of this section are applicable to all claims governed by part 3, with the exception that paragraph (b) of this section, regarding intent to file a claim, does not apply to supplemental claims.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Request for an application for benefits.</I> A claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not of full age or capacity, who indicates a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA, by a communication or action, to include an electronic mail that is transmitted through VA's electronic portal or otherwise, that does not meet the standards of a complete claim is considered a request for an application form for benefits under &#xA7; 3.150(a). Upon receipt of such a communication or action, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Intent to file a claim.</I> A claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of claimant who is not of full age or capacity may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of &#xA7; 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.
</P>
<P>(1) An intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of the following three ways:
</P>
<P>(i) Saved electronic application. When an application otherwise meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool within a VA web-based electronic claims application system prior to filing of a complete claim, VA will consider that application to be an intent to file a claim.
</P>
<P>(ii) Written intent on prescribed intent to file a claim form. The submission to an agency of original jurisdiction of a signed and dated intent to file a claim, on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose, will be accepted as an intent to file a claim.
</P>
<P>(iii) Oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing. An oral statement of intent to file a claim will be accepted if it is directed to a VA employee designated to receive such a communication, the VA employee receiving this information follows the provisions set forth in &#xA7; 3.217(b), and the VA employee documents the date VA received the claimant's intent to file a claim in the claimant's records.
</P>
<P>(2) An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based. To the extent a claimant provides this or other extraneous information on the designated form referenced in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that the form does not solicit, the provision of such information is of no effect other than that it is added to the file for appropriate consideration as evidence in support of a complete claim if filed. In particular, if a claimant identifies specific medical condition(s) on which the claim is based in an intent to file a claim, this extraneous information does not convert the intent to file a claim into a complete claim or a substantially complete application. Extraneous information provided in an oral communication under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is of no effect and generally will not be recorded in the record of the claimant's intent to file.
</P>
<P>(3) Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.
</P>
<P>(4) If an intent to file a claim is not submitted in the form required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section or a complete claim is not filed within 1 year of the receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will not take further action unless a new claim or a new intent to file a claim is received.
</P>
<P>(5) An intent to file a claim received from a service organization, an attorney, or agent indicating a represented claimant's intent to file a claim may not be accepted if a power of attorney was not executed at the time the communication was written. VA will only accept an oral intent to file from a service organization, an attorney, or agent if a power of attorney is of record at the time the oral communication is received by the designated VA employee.
</P>
<P>(6) VA will not recognize more than one intent to file concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension). If an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior intent to file will have no effect. If, however, VA receives an intent to file followed by a complete claim and later another intent to file for the same benefit is submitted within 1 year of the previous intent to file, VA will recognize the subsequent intent to file to establish an effective date for any award granted for the next complete claim, provided it is received within 1 year of the subsequent intent to file.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Incomplete application form.</I> Upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted on a paper application form prescribed by the Secretary that is not complete as defined in &#xA7; 3.160(a) of this section, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary. If a complete claim is submitted within 1 year of receipt of such incomplete application form prescribed by the Secretary, VA will consider it as filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form prescribed by the Secretary that did not meet the standards of a complete claim. See &#xA7; 3.160(a) for Complete Claim.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Claims.</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Requirement for complete claim and date of claim.</I> A complete claim is required for all types of claims, and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation or award of benefits under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Supplemental claims.</I> Upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted in writing or electronically on a supplemental claim form prescribed by the Secretary that is not complete as defined in &#xA7; 3.160(a) of this section, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim (see &#xA7; 3.2501).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>For other types of claims.</I> If VA receives a complete claim within 1 year of the filing of an intent to file a claim that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim. Only one complete claim for a benefit (<I>e.g.,</I> compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim. In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim. In the event that VA receives both an intent to file a claim and an incomplete application form before the complete claim as defined in &#xA7; 3.160(a) is filed, the complete claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of whichever was filed first provided it is perfected within the necessary timeframe, but in no event, will the complete claim be considered filed more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the complete claim.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Scope of claim.</I> Once VA receives a complete claim, VA will adjudicate as part of the claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision (e.g., entitlement to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits, entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 CFR 3.350, entitlement to adaptive automobile allowance, etc.). The claimant may, but need not, assert entitlement to ancillary benefits at the time the complete claim is filed. VA will also consider all lay and medical evidence of record in order to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition, including those identified by the rating criteria for that condition in 38 CFR Part 4, VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. VA's decision on an issue within a claim implies that VA has determined that evidence of record does not support entitlement for any other issues that are reasonably within the scope of the issues addressed in that decision. VA's decision that addresses all outstanding issues enumerated in the complete claim implies that VA has determined evidence of record does not support entitlement for any other issues that are reasonably within the scope of the issues enumerated in the complete claim.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.156 New evidence.</HEAD>
<P>New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>New and material evidence.</I> For claims to reopen decided prior to the effective date provided in &#xA7; 19.2(a), the following standards apply. A claimant may reopen a finally adjudicated legacy claim by submitting new and material evidence. New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.

<P>(b) <I>Pending legacy claims not under the modernized review system.</I>New and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed (including evidence received prior to an appellate decision and referred to the agency of original jurisdiction by the Board of Veterans Appeals without consideration in that decision in accordance with the provisions of &#xA7; 20.1304(b)(1) of this chapter), will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.

<P>(c) <I>Service department records.</I> (1) Notwithstanding any other section in this part, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section. Such records include, but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(i) Service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, regardless of whether such records mention the veteran by name, as long as the other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met;
</P>
<P>(ii) Additional service records forwarded by the Department of Defense or the service department to VA any time after VA's original request for service records; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Declassified records that could not have been obtained because the records were classified when VA decided the claim.
</P>
<P>(2) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to records that VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim because the records did not exist when VA decided the claim, or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for VA to identify and obtain the records from the respective service department or from any other official source.
</P>
<P>(3) An award made based all or in part on the records identified by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim.
</P>
<P>(4) A retroactive evaluation of disability resulting from disease or injury subsequently service connected on the basis of the new evidence from the service department must be supported adequately by medical evidence. Where such records clearly support the assignment of a specific rating over a part or the entire period of time involved, a retroactive evaluation will be assigned accordingly, except as it may be affected by the filing date of the original claim.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.159 Department of Veterans Affairs assistance in developing claims.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Competent medical evidence</I> means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. Competent medical evidence may also mean statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises. It would also include statements contained in authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Competent lay evidence</I> means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Substantially complete application</I> means an application containing:
</P>
<P>(i) The claimant's name;
</P>
<P>(ii) His or her relationship to the veteran, if applicable;
</P>
<P>(iii) Sufficient service information for VA to verify the claimed service, if applicable;
</P>
<P>(iv) The benefit sought and any medical condition(s) on which it is based;
</P>
<P>(v) The claimant's signature; and
</P>
<P>(vi) In claims for nonservice-connected disability or death pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation, a statement of income;
</P>
<P>(vii) In supplemental claims, identification or inclusion of potentially new evidence (see &#xA7; 3.2501);
</P>
<P>(viii) For higher-level reviews, identification of the date of the decision for which review is sought.
</P>
<P>(4) For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, <I>event</I> means one or more incidents associated with places, types, and circumstances of service giving rise to disability.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Information</I> means non-evidentiary facts, such as the claimant's Social Security number or address; the name and military unit of a person who served with the veteran; or the name and address of a medical care provider who may have evidence pertinent to the claim.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>VA's duty to notify claimants of necessary information or evidence.</I> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this section, when VA receives a complete or substantially complete initial or supplemental claim, VA will notify the claimant of any information and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the &#x201C;notice&#x201D;) In the notice, VA will inform the claimant which information and evidence, if any, that the claimant is to provide to VA and which information and evidence, if any, that VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant. The information and evidence that the claimant is informed that the claimant is to provide must be provided within one year of the date of the notice. If the claimant has not responded to the notice within 30 days, VA may decide the claim prior to the expiration of the one-year period based on all the information and evidence contained in the file, including information and evidence it has obtained on behalf of the claimant and any VA medical examinations or medical opinions. If VA does so, however, and the claimant subsequently provides the information and evidence within one year of the date of the notice in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, VA must readjudicate the claim.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(2) If VA receives an incomplete application for benefits, it will notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application and will defer assistance until the claimant submits this information.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5102(b), 5103A(3))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(3) No duty to provide the notice described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section arises:
</P>
<P>(i) Upon receipt of a supplemental claim under &#xA7; 3.2501 within one year of the date VA issues notice of a prior decision;
</P>
<P>(ii) Upon receipt of a request for higher-level review under &#xA7; 3.2601;
</P>
<P>(iii) Upon receipt of a Notice of Disagreement under &#xA7; 20.202 of this chapter; or
</P>
<P>(iv) When, as a matter of law, entitlement to the benefit claimed cannot be established.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103(a), 5103A(a)(2))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(4) After VA has issued a notice of decision, submission of information and evidence substantiating a claim must be accomplished through the proper filing of a review option in accordance with &#xA7; 3.2500 on a form prescribed by the Secretary. New and relevant evidence may be submitted in connection with either the filing of a supplemental claim under &#xA7; 3.2501 or the filing of a Notice of Disagreement with the Board under 38 CFR 20.202, on forms prescribed by the Secretary, and election of a Board docket that permits the filing of new evidence (see 38 CFR 20.302 and 20.303).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>VA's duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence.</I> VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence to substantiate all substantially complete initial and supplemental claims, and when a claim is returned for readjudication by a higher-level adjudicator or the Board after identification of a duty to assist error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction, until the time VA issues notice of a decision on a claim or returned claim. VA will make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate the claim. VA will not pay any fees charged by a custodian to provide records requested. When a claim is returned for readjudication by a higher-level adjudicator or the Board after identification of a duty to assist error, the agency of original jurisdiction has a duty to correct any other duty to assist errors not identified by the higher-level adjudicator or the Board.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Obtaining records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency.</I> VA will make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency, to include records from State or local governments, private medical care providers, current or former employers, and other non-Federal governmental sources. Such reasonable efforts will generally consist of an initial request for the records and, if the records are not received, at least one follow-up request. A follow-up request is not required if a response to the initial request indicates that the records sought do not exist or that a follow-up request for the records would be futile. If VA receives information showing that subsequent requests to this or another custodian could result in obtaining the records sought, then reasonable efforts will include an initial request and, if the records are not received, at least one follow-up request to the new source or an additional request to the original source.
</P>
<P>(i) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from non-Federal agency or department custodians. The claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records, including the person, company, agency, or other custodian holding the records; the approximate time frame covered by the records; and, in the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided.
</P>
<P>(ii) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of existing records in a form acceptable to the person, company, agency, or other custodian holding the records.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(b))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(2) <I>Obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency.</I> VA will make as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency. These records include but are not limited to military records, including service medical records; medical and other records from VA medical facilities; records from non-VA facilities providing examination or treatment at VA expense; and records from other Federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration. VA will end its efforts to obtain records from a Federal department or agency only if VA concludes that the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records would be futile. Cases in which VA may conclude that no further efforts are required include those in which the Federal department or agency advises VA that the requested records do not exist or the custodian does not have them.
</P>
<P>(i) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from Federal agency or department custodians. If requested by VA, the claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records, including the custodian or agency holding the records; the approximate time frame covered by the records; and, in the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided. In the case of records requested to corroborate a claimed stressful event in service, the claimant must provide information sufficient for the records custodian to conduct a search of the corroborative records.
</P>
<P>(ii) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of existing records in a form acceptable to the custodian or agency holding the records.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(b))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(3) <I>Obtaining records in compensation claims.</I> In a claim for disability compensation, VA will make efforts to obtain the claimant's service medical records, if relevant to the claim; other relevant records pertaining to the claimant's active military, naval, air, or space service that are held or maintained by a governmental entity; VA medical records or records of examination or treatment at non-VA facilities authorized by VA; and any other relevant records held by any Federal department or agency. The claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records including the custodian or agency holding the records; the approximate time frame covered by the records; and, in the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(c))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(4) <I>Providing medical examinations or obtaining medical opinions.</I> (i) In a claim for disability compensation, VA will provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion based upon a review of the evidence of record if VA determines it is necessary to decide the claim. A medical examination or medical opinion is necessary if the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim, but:
</P>
<P>(A) Contains competent lay or medical evidence of a current diagnosed disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability;
</P>
<P>(B) Establishes that the veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in service, or has a disease or symptoms of a disease listed in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.309, 3.313, 3.316, 3.317, and 3.320 manifesting during an applicable presumptive period provided the claimant has the required service or triggering event to qualify for that presumption; and
</P>
<P>(C) Indicates that the claimed disability or symptoms may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease in service or with another service-connected disability.
</P>
<P>(ii) Paragraph (4)(i)(C) could be satisfied by competent evidence showing post-service treatment for a condition, or other possible association with military service.
</P>
<P>(iii) For requests to reopen a finally adjudicated claim received prior to the effective date provided in &#xA7; 19.2(a) of this chapter, this paragraph (c)(4) applies only if new and material evidence is presented or secured as prescribed in &#xA7; 3.156.
</P>
<P>(iv) This paragraph (c)(4) applies to a supplemental claim only if new and relevant evidence under &#xA7; 3.2501 is presented or secured.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(d))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(d) <I>Circumstances where VA will refrain from or discontinue providing assistance.</I> VA will refrain from providing assistance in obtaining evidence for an initial or supplemental claim if the substantially complete application for benefits indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that any assistance VA would provide to the claimant would substantiate the claim. VA will discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence for a claim if the evidence obtained indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that further assistance would substantiate the claim. Circumstances in which VA will refrain from or discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence include, but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(1) The claimant's ineligibility for the benefit sought because of lack of qualifying service, lack of veteran status, or other lack of legal eligibility;
</P>
<P>(2) Claims that are inherently incredible or clearly lack merit; and
</P>

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.203 Service records as evidence of service and character of discharge.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Evidence submitted by a claimant.</I> For the purpose of establishing entitlement to pension, compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation or burial benefits the Department of Veterans Affairs may accept evidence of service submitted by a claimant (or sent directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs by the service department), such as a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or original Certificate of Discharge, without verification from the appropriate service department if the evidence meets the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) The evidence is a document issued by the service department. A copy of an original document is acceptable if:
</P>
<P>(i) The copy was issued by the service department; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The copy was issued by a public custodian of records who certifies that it is a true and exact copy of the document in the custodian's custody; or
</P>
<P>(iii) The copy was submitted by an accredited agent, attorney or service organization representative who has successfully completed VA-prescribed training on military records, and who certifies that it is a true and exact copy of either an original document or of a copy issued by the service department or a public custodian of records; or
</P>
<P>(iv) The Department of Veterans Affairs is satisfied that an otherwise uncertified copy submitted by the claimant or by the claimant's representative is free from alteration; and
</P>
<P>(2) The document contains needed information as to length, time and character of service; and
</P>
<P>(3) In the opinion of the Department of Veterans Affairs the document is genuine and the information contained in it is accurate.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Additional requirements for pension claimants.</I> In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a document submitted to establish a creditable period of wartime service for pension entitlement may be accepted without verification if the document (or other evidence of record) shows:
</P>
<P>(1) Service of 4 months or more; or
</P>
<P>(2) Discharge for disability incurred in line of duty; or
</P>
<P>(3) Ninety days creditable service based on records from the service department such as hospitalization for 90 days for a line of duty disability.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Verification from the service department.</I> When the claimant does not submit evidence of service or the evidence submitted does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section (and paragraph (b) of this section in pension claims), the Department of Veterans Affairs shall request verification of service from the service department. However, payment of nonservice-connected burial benefits may be authorized, if otherwise in order, based upon evidence of service which VA relied upon to authorize payment of compensation or pension during the veteran's lifetime, provided that there is no evidence which would serve to create doubt as to the correctness of that service evidence. If it appears that a length of service requirement may not be met (e.g., the 90 days wartime service requirement to receive pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521(j)), the Department of Veterans Affairs shall request a complete statement of service to determine if there are any periods of active service that are required to be excluded under &#xA7; 3.15.

<P>(2) VA shall require the types of evidence indicated in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.205 through 3.211 where: the claimant does not reside within a state; the claimant's statement on its face raises a question of its validity; the claimant's statement conflicts with other evidence of record; or, there is a reasonable indication, in the claimant's statement or otherwise, of fraud or misrepresentation of the relationship in question.

This evidence should be supplemented by affidavits or certified statements from two or more persons who know as the result of personal observation the reputed relationship which existed between the parties to the alleged marriage including the periods of cohabitation, places of residences, whether the parties held themselves out as married, and whether they were generally accepted as such in the communities in which they lived.

Where necessary to a determination because of conflicting information or protest by a party having an interest therein, proof of termination of a prior marriage will be shown by proof of death, or a certified copy or a certified abstract of final decree of divorce or annulment specifically reciting the effects of the decree.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.210 Child's relationship.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Legitimate child.</I> Where it is necessary to determine the legitimacy of a child, evidence will be required to establish the legality of the marriage of the mother of the child to the veteran or to show that the child is otherwise legitimate by State laws together with evidence of birth as outlined in &#xA7; 3.209. Where the legitimacy of a child is not a factor, evidence to establish legitimacy will not be required: <I>Provided,</I> That, evidence is on file which meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section sufficient to warrant recognition of the relationship of the child without regard to legitimacy.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Illegitimate child.</I> As to the mother of an illegitimate child, proof of birth is all that is required. As to the father, the sufficiency of evidence will be determined in accordance with the facts in the individual case. Proof of such relationship will consist of:
</P>
<P>(1) An acknowledgment in writing signed by him; or
</P>
<P>(2) Evidence that he has been identified as the child's father by a judicial decree ordering him to contribute to the child's support or for other purposes; or
</P>
<P>(3) Any other secondary evidence which reasonably supports a finding of relationship, as determined by an official authorized to approve such findings, such as:
</P>
<P>(i) A copy of the public record of birth or church record of baptism, showing that the veteran was the informant and was named as parent of the child; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Statements of persons who know that the veteran accepted the child as his; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Information obtained from service department or public records, such as school or welfare agencies, which shows that with his knowledge the veteran was named as the father of the child.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Adopted child.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section evidence of relationship will include a copy of the decree of adoption or a copy of the adoptive placement agreement and such other evidence as may be necessary.
</P>
<P>(1) In jurisdictions where petition must be made to the court for release of adoption documents or information, or where release of such documents or information is prohibited, the following may be accepted to establish the fact of adoption:
</P>
<P>(i) As to a child adopted into the veteran's family, a copy of the child's revised birth certificate.
</P>
<P>(ii) As to a child adopted out of the veteran's family, a statement over the signature of the judge or the clerk of the court setting forth the child's former name and the date of adoption, or a certified statement by the veteran, the veteran's surviving spouse, apportionee, or their fiduciaries setting forth the child's former name, date of birth, and the date and fact of adoption together with evidence indicating that the child's original public record of birth has been removed from such records. Where application is made for an apportionment under &#xA7; 3.458(d) on behalf of a child adopted out of the veteran's family, the evidence must be sufficient to establish the veteran as the natural parent of the child.
</P>
<P>(2) As to a child adopted by the veteran's surviving spouse after the veteran's death, the statement of the adoptive parent or custodian of the child will be accepted in absence of information to the contrary, to show that the child was a member of the veteran's household at the date of the veteran's death and that recurring contributions were not being received for the child's maintenance sufficient to provide for the major portion of the child's support, from any person other than the veteran or surviving spouse or from any public or private welfare organization which furnished services or assistance to children. (Pub. L. 86&#x2013;195)
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Stepchild.</I> Evidence of relationship of a stepchild will consist of proof of birth as outlined in &#xA7; 3.209, evidence of the marriage of the veteran to the natural parent of the child, and evidence that the child is a member of the veteran's household or was a member of the veteran's household at the date of the veteran's death.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.213 Change of status affecting entitlement.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> For the purpose of establishing entitlement to a higher rate of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on the existence of a dependent, VA will require evidence which satisfies the requirements of &#xA7; 3.204. For the purpose of reducing or discontinuing such benefits, a statement by a claimant or payee setting forth the month and year of change of status which would result in a reduction or discontinuance of benefits to that person will be accepted, in the absence of contradictory information. This includes:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Veteran.</I> A statement by the veteran setting forth the month and year of death of a spouse, child, or dependent parent.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Surviving spouse.</I> A statement by the surviving spouse or remarried surviving spouse setting forth the month and year of remarriage and any change of name. (An award for a child or children who are otherwise entitled may be made to commence the day following the date of discontinuance of any payments to the surviving spouse.)
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Child.</I> A statement by the veteran or surviving spouse (where an additional allowance is being paid to the veteran or surviving spouse for a child), or fiduciary, setting forth the month and year of the child's death, marriage, or discontinuance of school attendance. A similar statement by a child who is receiving payments direct will be accepted to establish the child's marriage or the discontinuance of school attendance. Where appropriate, the month and year of discontinuance of school attendance will be required in addition to the month and year of death or marriage of a child.

</P>
<P>(iii) When two parents or a parent and spouse resumed living together following a period of separation;
</P>
<P>(iv) Of divorce or death of a spouse.

<P>(b) <I>Date not reported.</I> If the month and year of the event is not reported, the award will be reduced or discontinued, whichever is appropriate, effective date of last payment. The payee will be requested to furnish within 60 days from the date of request a statement setting forth the date of the event. Where payments are continued at a reduced rate, the award will be discontinued effective date of last payment if the required statement is not received within the 60-day period. Payments on a discontinued award may be resumed, if otherwise in order, from the date of discontinuance if the necessary information is received within 1 year from the date of request; otherwise from the date of receipt of a new claim.

<P>(2) <I>Excess income.</I> Where the income exceeds the monthly amounts stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section dependency will be determined on the facts in the individual case under the principles outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. In such cases, dependency will not be held to exist if it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the claimant's estate be consumed for his or her maintenance.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Foreign residents.</I> There is no conclusive presumption of dependency. Dependency will be determined on the facts in the individual case under the principles outlined in this section.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Basic rule.</I> Dependency will be held to exist if the father or mother of the veteran does not have an income sufficient to provide reasonable maintenance for such father or mother and members of his or her family under legal age and for dependent adult members of the family if the dependency of such adult member results from mental or physical incapacity.
</P>
<P>(1) &#x201C;Reasonable Maintenance&#x201D; includes not only housing, food, clothing, and medical care sufficient to sustain life, but such items beyond the bare necessities as well as other requirements reasonably necessary to provide those conveniences and comforts of living suitable to and consistent with the parents' reasonable mode of life.

<P>(2) &#x201C;Member of the family&#x201D; means a person (other than spouse) including a relative in the ascending as well as descending class, whom the father or mother is under moral or legal obligation to support. In determining whether other members of the family under legal age are factors in necessary expenses of the mother or father, consideration will be given to any income from business or property (including trusts) actually available, directly or indirectly, to the mother or father for the support of the minor but not to the corpus of the estate or the income of the minor which is not so available.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Inception of dependency.</I> The fact that the veteran has made habitual contributions to the father or mother, or both, is not conclusive evidence that dependency existed but will be considered in connection with all other evidence.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.252 Annual income; pension; Mexican border period and later war periods.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Annual income limitations; old-law pension.</I> Where the right to old-law pension is payable under section 306(b) of Pub. L. 95&#x2013;588 (92 Stat. 2497), pension is not payable if the pensioner's annual income exceeds the income limitations prescribed by &#xA7; 3.26(c).

<P>(b) <I>Annual income and net worth limitations; Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211.</I> Pension is not payable to a veteran, surviving spouse or child whose annual income exceeds the limitations set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1521, 1541 or 1542; or to a veteran, surviving spouse or child if it is reasonable that some part of the claimant's estate be consumed for his or her maintenance. Where a veteran and spouse are living together, the separate income of the spouse will be considered as the veteran's income as provided in &#xA7; 3.262(b).

<P>(c) <I>Basic rule.</I> Payments of any kind or from any source will be counted as income unless specifically excluded. Income will be counted for the calendar year in which it is received and total income for the full calendar year will be considered except as provided in &#xA7; 3.260.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Veteran with a spouse.</I> For the purpose of determining eligibility under paragraph (b) of this section the pension rates provided by 38 U.S.C. 1521(c) may be authorized for a married veteran if he or she is living with or, if estranged, is reasonably contributing to the support of his or her spouse. The determination of &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; contribution will be based on all the circumstances in the case, considering the income and estate of the veteran and the separate income and estate of the spouse. Apportionment of the veteran's pension under &#xA7; 3.451 meets the requirement of reasonable contribution.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Surviving spouse with a child</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Child.</I> The term &#x201C;child&#x201D; means a child as defined in &#xA7; 3.57. Where a veteran's child is born after the veteran dies, the surviving spouse will not be considered a surviving spouse with a child prior to the child's date of birth.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Veteran's child not in surviving spouse's custody.</I> Where the veteran was survived by a surviving spouse and by a child, the income increments for a surviving spouse and child apply even though the child is not the child of the surviving spouse and not in his or her custody.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Income of child.</I> The separate income received by a child or children, regardless of custody, will not be considered in computing the surviving spouse's income. Where the separate income of the child is turned over to the surviving spouse, only so much of the money as is left after deducting any expenses for maintenance of the child will be considered the surviving spouse's income.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Alternative rate.</I> Whenever the monthly pension rate payable to the surviving spouse under the formula in 38 U.S.C. 1541(c) is less than the rate payable for one child under section 1542 if the surviving spouse were not entitled, the surviving spouse will be paid the child's rate.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Income over maximum; reduced aid and attendance allowance.</I> Beginning January 1, 1977, veterans in need of regular aid and attendance who are not receiving pension because their income exceeds the applicable statutory limitation may be eligible for a reduced aid and attendance allowance. The amount payable is the regular aid and attendance allowance authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1521(d)(1) reduced by 16.6 percent for each $100, or portion thereof, by which the veteran's annual income exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation. The reduced aid and attendance allowance is payable when:
</P>
<P>(1) A veteran in need of regular aid and attendance is denied pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521 solely because the veteran's annual income exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation in 38 U.S.C. 1521 (b)(3) and (c)(3); or
</P>
<P>(2) Pension payable under 38 U.S.C. 1521 to a veteran in need of regular aid and attendance is discontinued solely because the veteran's annual income exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation in 38 U.S.C. 1521 (b)(3) or (c)(3); and
</P>
<P>(3) The veteran's annual income exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation in 38 U.S.C. 1521 (b)(3) or (c)(3) by an amount not greater than the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1521 (d)(2).

</P>
<P>(1) Income;

</P>
<P>(3) Except for a parent who has attained 72 years of age and has been paid dependency and indemnity compensation during two consecutive calendar years, the Secretary shall require an eligibility verification report from individuals receiving parents' dependency and indemnity compensation under the following circumstances:
</P>
<P>(i) If the Social Security Administration has not verified the beneficiary's Social Security number and, if the beneficiary is married, his or her spouse's Social Security number.
</P>
<P>(ii) If there is reason to believe that the beneficiary or, if the spouse's income could affect entitlement, his or her spouse may have received income other than Social Security during the current or previous calendar year; or
</P>
<P>(iii) If the Secretary determines that an eligibility verification report is necessary to preserve program integrity.
</P>
<P>(4) An individual who applies for or receives pension or parents' dependency and indemnity compensation as defined in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.3 or 3.5 of this part shall, as a condition of receipt or continued receipt of benefits, furnish the Department of Veterans Affairs an eligibility verification report upon request.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.260 Computation of income.</HEAD>
<P>For entitlement to pension or dependency and indemnity compensation, income will be counted for the calendar year in which it is received.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Installments.</I> Income will be determined by the total amount received or anticipated during the calendar year.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Deferred determinations.</I> Where there is doubt as to the amount of the anticipated income, pension or dependency and indemnity compensation will be allowed at the lowest appropriate rate or will be withheld, as may be in order, until the end of the calendar year when the total income received during the year may be determined.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Proportionate income limitations; excess income.</I> A proportionate income limitation will be established under the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this section except where application of a proportionate income limitation would result in payment of a lower rate than would be payable on the basis of income for the full calendar year.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Proportionate income limitations; computation.</I> Income limitations will be computed proportionately for the purpose of determining initial entitlement, or for resuming payments on an award which was discontinued for a reason other than excess income or a change in marital or dependency status. A proportionate income limitation will be established for the period from the date of entitlement to the end of that calendar year. The total amount of income received by the claimant during that period will govern the payment of benefits. Income received prior to the date of entitlement will be disregarded.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Proportionate income limitations; spouse.</I> In determining whether proportionate computation is applicable to a claim under Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211 (73 Stat. 432), the total income for the calendar year of entitlement of both veteran and that of the spouse available for use of the veteran will be considered. If a proportionate income limitation is then applicable, it will be applied to both the veteran's and the spouse's income. The spouse's income will not be included, however, where his or her total income for the calendar year does not exceed $1,200.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Rate changes.</I> In years after that for which entitlement to pension or dependency and indemnity compensation has been established or reestablished as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, total income for the calendar year will govern the payment of benefits. Where there is a change in the conditions of entitlement because of a change in marital or dependency status, entitlement for each period will be determined separately. For the period when the claimant was married or had a dependent, the rate payable will be determined under the annual income limitation or increment applicable to a claimant who is married or has a dependent. For the period when the claimant was unmarried or without a dependent, the rate payable will be determined under the annual income limitation or increment applicable to a claimant who is not married or has no dependent. Since these determinations will be based on total income for the calendar year, it is not material whether such income was received before or after the change of status.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Fractions of dollars.</I> In computing a claimant's annual income a fraction of a dollar will be disregarded for the purpose of determining entitlement to monthly payments of pension and dependency and indemnity compensation.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.262 Evaluation of income.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Total income.</I> All income from sources such as wages, salaries, earnings, bonuses from employers, income from a business or profession or from investments or rents as well as the fair value of personal services, goods or room and board received in lieu thereof will be included.
</P>
<P>(1) Salary is not determined by &#x201C;takehome&#x201D; pay, but includes deductions made under a retirement act or plan and amounts withheld by virtue of income tax laws.
</P>
<P>(2) The gross income from a business or profession may be reduced by the necessary operating expenses, such as cost of goods sold, or expenditures for rent, taxes, and upkeep. Depreciation is not a deductible expense. The cost of repairs or replacement may be deducted. The value of an increase in stock inventory of a business is not considered income.
</P>
<P>(3) A loss sustained in operating a business, profession, or farm or from investments may not be deducted from income derived from any other source.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Income of spouse.</I> Income of the spouse will be determined under the rules applicable to income of the claimant.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Parents.</I> Where the mother and father, or remarried parent and spouse are living together, the total combined income will be considered in determining dependency, or in determining the rate of dependency and indemnity compensation payable to the parent. This rule is equally applicable where both parents have remarried and each is living with his or her spouse. If the remarriage of a parent has been terminated, or the parent is separated from his or her spouse, income of the spouse will be excluded.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Veterans.</I> The separate income of the spouse of a disabled veteran who is entitled to pension under laws in effect on June 30, 1960, will not be considered. Where pension is payable under section 306(a) of Pub. L. 95&#x2013;588, to a veteran who is living with a spouse there will be included as income of the veteran all income of the spouse in excess of whichever is the greater, the amount of the spouse income exclusion specified in section 306(a)(2)(B) of Pub. L. 95&#x2013;588 as increased from time to time under section 306 (a)(3) of Pub. L. 95&#x2013;588 or the total earned income of the spouse, which is reasonably available to or for the veteran, unless hardship to the veteran would result. Each time there is an increase in the spouse income exclusion pursuant to section 306(a)(3) of Pub. L. 95&#x2013;588, the actual amount of the exclusion will be published in the &#x201C;Notices&#x201D; section of the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The presumption that inclusion of such income is available to the veteran and would not work a hardship on him or her may be rebutted by evidence of unavailability or of expenses beyond the usual family requirements.

</PARAUTH>
<P>(c) <I>Maintenance.</I> The value of maintenance furnished by a relative, friend, or a charitable organization (civic or governmental) will not be considered income. Where the claimant is maintained in a rest home or other community institution or facility, public or private, because of impaired health or advanced age, money paid to the home or to the claimant to cover the cost of maintenance will not be considered income, regardless of whether it is furnished by a relative, friend or charitable organization. The expense of maintenance is not deductible if it is paid from the claimant's income, except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section in claims for dependency and indemnity compensation.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Charitable donations.</I> Charitable donations from public or private relief or welfare organizations will not be considered income except in claims for pension under laws in effect on June 30, 1960. In the latter cases, additional charitable allowances received by a claimant for members of his or her family may not be divided per capita in determining the amount of the claimant's income.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Retirement benefits; general.</I> Retirement benefits, including an annuity or endowment, paid under a Federal, State, municipal, or private business or industrial plan are considered income as limited by this paragraph. Where the payments received consist of part principal and part interest, interest will not be counted separately.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Protected pension.</I> Except as provided in this paragraph (e)(1), effective January 1, 1965, in determining income for pension purposes under laws in effect on June 30, 1960, 10 percent of the retirement payments received by a veteran, surviving spouse, or child will be excluded. The remaining 90 percent will be considered income as received. Where the retirement benefit is based on the claimant's own employment, payments will not be considered income until the amount of the claimant's personal contribution (as distinguished from amounts contributed by the employer) has been received. Thereafter the 10 percent exclusion will apply.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Pension; Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211.</I> Except as provided in this subparagraph, effective January 1, 1965, in determining income for pension purposes, under Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211 (73 Stat. 432), 10 percent of the retirement payments received by a veteran, the veteran's spouse, surviving spouse, or child will be excluded. The remaining 90 percent will be considered income as received. Where a person was receiving or entitled to receive pension and retirement benefits based on his or her own employment on December 31, 1964, the retirement payments will not be considered income until the amount of the claimant personal contribution (as distinguished from amounts contributed by the employer) has been received. Thereafter the 10 percent exclusion will apply.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Compensation.</I> In determining dependency of a parent for compensation purposes, all payments will be considered income as received.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Dependency and indemnity compensation.</I> Except as provided in this subparagraph, effective January 1, 1967, in determining income for dependency and indemnity compensation purposes, 10 percent of the retirement payments received by a deceased veteran's parent or by the parent's spouse will be excluded.

<P>(f) <I>Social security benefits.</I> Old age and survivor's insurance and disability insurance under title II of the Social Security Act will be considered income as a retirement benefit under the rules contained in paragraph (e) of this section. Benefits received under noncontributory programs, such as old age assistance, aid to dependent children, and supplemental security income are subject to the rules contained in paragraph (d) of this section applicable to charitable donations. The lumpsum death payment under title II of the Social Security Act will be considered as income except in claims for dependency and indemnity compensation and for pension under Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211 (73 Stat. 432).
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Railroad retirement benefits</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Parents, surviving spouses and children.</I> Retirement benefits received from the Railroad Retirement Board will be considered as income under the rules contained in paragraph (e) of this section. (See paragraph (h) of this section as to waivers.)
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Veterans.</I> Effective July 1, 1959, retirement benefits received from the Railroad Retirement Board were excluded from consideration as income in determining eligibility for disability pension. (45 U.S.C. 228s&#x2013;1) This exclusion continues to be applicable to claims under laws in effect on June 30, 1960. For purposes of section 306 pension, such retirement benefits will be considered as income under the rules contained in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Retirement benefits waived.</I> Except as provided in this paragraph, retirement benefits (pension or retirement payments) which have been waived will be included as income. For the purpose of determining dependency of a parent, or eligibility of a parent for dependency and indemnity compensation or eligibility of a veteran, surviving spouse, or child for pension under laws in effect on June 30, 1960, retirement benefits from the following sources which have been waived pursuant to Federal statute will not be considered as income:
</P>
<P>(1) Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund;

</P>
<P>(3) District of Columbia, firemen, policemen, or public school teachers;

<P>(i) <I>Compensation</I> (<I>civilian</I>) <I>for injury or death.</I> (1) Compensation paid by the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, Department of Labor (of the United States), or by Social Security Administration, or by Railroad Retirement Board, or pursuant to any workmen's compensation or employer's liability statute, or damages collected because of personal injury or death, less medical, legal, or other expenses incident to the injury or death, or the collection or recovery of such moneys will be considered income as received, except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

<P>(2) For pension, effective October 7, 1966, and for dependency and indemnity compensation effective January 1, 1967, if payments based on permanent and total disability or death are received from the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, Social Security Administration or Railroad Retirement Board, or pursuant to any workmen's compensation or employer's liability statute, there will be excluded 10 percent of the payments received after deduction of medical, legal, and other expenses as authorized by paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The 10 percent exclusion does not apply to damages collected incident to a tort suit under other than an employer's liability law of the United States or a political subdivision of the United States, or to determinations of dependency for compensation purposes.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Commercial insurance</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Annuity or endowment insurance.</I> For pension, effective January 1, 1965, or for dependency and indemnity compensation, effective January 1, 1967, the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply. In such cases, 10 percent of the payments received will be excluded. In dependency and indemnity compensation claims, where the parent is receiving or entitled to receive dependency and indemnity compensation on December 31, 1966, and is also receiving or entitled to receive annuity payments on that date, or endowment insurance matures on or before that date, no part of the payments received will be considered income until the full amount of the consideration has been received, after which 10 percent of the amount received will be excluded. For compensation, the full amount of each payment is considered income as received.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Life insurance; general.</I> In determining dependency, or eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation, or for section 306 pension the full amount of payments is considered income as received. For section 306 pension, effective October 7, 1966, and for dependency and indemnity compensation, effective January 1, 1967, 10 percent of the payments received will be excluded.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Life insurance; old-law pension.</I> For pension under laws in effect on June 30, 1960, 10 percent of the payments received will be excluded. Where it is considered that life insurance was received in a lump sum in the calendar year in which the veteran died and payments are actually received in succeeding years, no part of the payments received in succeeding years will be considered income until an amount equal to the lump-sum face value of the policy has been received, after which 10 percent of the payments received will be excluded. The 10 percent exclusion is authorized effective October 7, 1966.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Disability, accident or health insurance.</I> For pension, effective October 7, 1966, and for dependency and indemnity compensation, effective January 1, 1967, there will be excluded 10 percent of the payments received for disability after deduction of medical, legal, or other expenses incident to the disability.

</P>
<P>(k) <I>Property</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Ownership.</I> The terms of the recorded deed or other evidence of title will constitute evidence of ownership of real or personal property. This includes property acquired through purchase, bequest or inheritance except that, effective January 1, 1971, amounts in joint accounts in banks and similar institutions acquired by reason of the death of another joint owner shall not be considered income of a survivor for section 306 pension purposes. With the foregoing exception, if property is owned jointly each person will be considered as owning a proportionate share. The claimant's share of property held in partnership will be determined on the facts found. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the claimant's statement as to the terms of ownership will be accepted.
</P>

</PARAUTH>
<P>(2) <I>Income-producing property.</I> Income received from real or personal property owned by the claimant will be counted. The claimant's share will be determined in proportion to his right according to the rules of ownership.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Sale of property.</I> Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(4) and (5) of this section, net profit from the sale of real or personal property will be counted. In determining net profit from the sale of property owned prior to the date of entitlement, the value at the date of entitlement will be considered in relation to the selling price. Where payments are received in installments, payments will not be considered income until the claimant has received amounts equal to the value of the property at the date of entitlement. Principal and interest will not be counted separately.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Homes.</I> Net profit from the sale of the claimant's residence which is received during the calendar year of sale will not be considered as income under the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(i) To the extent that it is applied within the calendar year of the sale, or the succeeding calendar year, to the purchase price of another residence as his principal dwelling;
</P>
<P>(ii) Such application of the net profit is reported within 1 year following the date so applied, and
</P>
<P>(iii) The net profit is so applied after January 10, 1962, to a purchase made after said date.
</P>
<FP>This exclusion will not apply where the net profit is applied to the price of a home purchased earlier than the calendar year preceding the calendar year of sale of the old residence.
</FP>
<P>(5) <I>Sale of property; section 306 pension and dependency and indemnity compensation.</I> For pension under section 306 pension and for dependency and indemnity compensation, profit from the sale of real or personal property other than in the course of a business will not be considered income. This applies to property acquired either before or after the date of entitlement. Any amounts received in excess of the sales price will be counted as income. Where payments are received in installments, principal and interest will not be counted separately. For pension, this provision is effective January 1, 1965; for dependency and indemnity compensation, January 1, 1967.

<P>(6) <I>Payments on mortgages on real property; section 306 pension.</I> Effective January 1, 1971, for the purposes of section 306 pension, an amount equaling any prepayments made by a veteran or surviving spouse on a mortgage or similar type security instrument in existence at the death of veteran or spouse on real property which prior to the death was the principal residence of the veteran and spouse will be excluded from consideration as income if such payment was made after the death and prior to the close of the year succeeding the year of death.

<P>(l) <I>Unusual medical expenses.</I> Within the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (4) of this section there will be excluded from the amount of the claimant's annual income any unreimbursed amounts which have been paid within the calendar year for unusual medical expenses regardless of the year the indebtedness was incurred. The term <I>unusual</I> means <I>excessive.</I> It does not describe the nature of a medical condition but rather the amount expended for medical treatment in relationship to the claimant's resources available for sustaining a reasonable mode of life. Unreimbursed expenditures which exceed 5 percent of the claimant's reported annual income will be considered unusual. Health, accident, sickness and hospitalization insurance premiums will be included as medical expenses in determining whether the claimant's unreimbursed medical expenses meet the criterion for <I>unusual.</I> A claimant's statement as to amounts expended for medical expenses ordinarily will be accepted unless the circumstances create doubt as to its credibility. An estimate based on a clear and reasonable expectation that unusual medical expenditure will be realized may be accepted for the purpose of authorizing prospective payments of benefits subject to necessary adjustment in the award upon receipt of an amended estimate or after the end of the calendar year upon receipt of an income questionnaire. For the definition of what constitutes a medical expense, see &#xA7; 3.278, Deductible medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Veterans.</I> For the purpose of section 306 pension, there will be excluded unreimbursed amounts paid by the veteran for unusual medical expenses of self, spouse, and other relatives of the veteran in the ascending as well as descending class who are members or constructive members of the veteran's household and whom the veteran has a moral or legal obligation to support.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Surviving spouses.</I> For the purpose of section 306 pension, there will be excluded unreimbursed amounts paid by the surviving spouse for the unusual medical expenses of self, the veteran's children, and other relatives of the surviving spouse in the ascending as well as descending class who are members or constructive members of the surviving spouse's household and whom the surviving spouse has a moral or legal obligation to support.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Children.</I> For the purpose of section 306 pension, there will be excluded unreimbursed amounts paid by a child for the unusual medical expenses of self, parent, and brothers and sisters of the child.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Parents.</I> For dependency and indemnity compensation purposes there will be excluded unreimbursed amounts paid by the parent for the unusual medical expenses of self, spouse, and other relatives of the parent in the ascending as well as descending class who are members or constructive members of the parent's household and whom the parent has a moral or legal obligation to support. If the combined annual income of the parent and the parent's spouse is the basis for dependency and indemnity compensation, the exclusion is applicable to the combined annual income and extends to the unusual unreimbursed medical expenses of the spouse's relatives in the ascending as well as descending class who are members or constructive members of the household and whom the parent's spouse has a moral or legal obligation to support.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.263 Corpus of estate; net worth.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The following rules are for application in determining the corpus of estate of a parent where dependency is a factor under &#xA7; 3.250, and the net worth of a veteran, surviving spouse, or child where pension is subject to Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211 (73 Stat. 432) under &#xA7; 3.252(b). Only the estate of the parent, in claims based on dependency, or the estate of the veteran, surviving spouse, or child-claimant in claims for pension, will be considered. In the absence of contradictory information, the claimant's statement as to ownership and estimate of value will be accepted.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definition. Corpus of estate</I> and <I>net worth</I> mean the market value, less mortgages or other encumbrances, of all real and personal property owned by the claimant except the claimant's dwelling (single-family unit) including a reasonable lot area, and personal effects suitable to and consistent with the claimant's reasonable mode of life.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Ownership.</I> See &#xA7; 3.262(k).
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Evaluation.</I> In determining whether some part of the claimant's estate should be consumed for his or her maintenance, consideration will be given to the amount of the claimant's income, together with the following factors: whether the property can be readily converted into cash at no substantial sacrifice; ability to dispose of property as limited by community property laws; life expectancy; number of dependents who meet the requirements of &#xA7; 3.250(b)(2); potential rate of depletion, including unusual medical expenses under the principles outlined in &#xA7; 3.262(l) for the claimant and his or her dependents.
</P>
<P>(e) VA will exclude from the corpus of estate or net worth any amount designated by statute as not countable as a resource. See &#xA7; 3.279.

<P>(1) <I>Recurring income.</I> Recurring income means income which is received or anticipated in equal amounts and at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.), and which will continue throughout an entire 12-month annualization period. The amount of recurring income for pension purposes will be the amount received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period. Recurring income which terminates prior to being counted for at least one full 12-month annualization period will be treated as nonrecurring income for computation purposes.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Irregular income.</I> Irregular income means income which is received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period, but which is received in unequal amounts or at irregular intervals. The amount of irregular income for pension purposes will be the amount received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period following initial receipt of such income.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Nonrecurring income.</I> Nonrecurring income means income received or anticipated on a one-time basis during a 12-month annualization period (e.g., an inheritance).

<P>(c) <I>Business, farm or professional income.</I> (1) This includes gross income from a business, farm or profession as reduced by the necessary operating expenses such as cost of goods sold, or expenditures for rent, taxes, and upkeep, or costs of repairs or replacements. The value of an increase in stock inventory of a business is not considered income.
</P>
<P>(2) Depreciation is not a deductible expense.
</P>
<P>(3) A loss sustained in operating a business, profession, farm, or from investments, may not be deducted from income derived from any other source.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Income from property.</I> Income from real or personal property is countable as income of the property's owner. The terms of a recorded deed or other evidence of title shall constitute evidence of ownership. This includes property acquired through purchase, gift, devise, or descent. If property is owned jointly, income of the various owners shall be determined in proportion to shares of ownership of the property. The owner's shares of income held in partnership shall be determined on the basis of the facts found.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Installments.</I> Income shall be determined by the total amount received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(f) <I>Deferred determinations.</I> (1) When an individual is unable to predict with certainty the amount of countable annual income, the annual rate of improved pension shall be reduced by the greatest amount of anticipated countable income until the end of the 12-month annualization period, when total income received during that period will be determined and adjustments in pension payable made accordingly.

<P>(2) When a claimed dependent is shown to have income which exceeds the additional amount of benefits payable based on the claimed dependency, but evidence requirements of &#xA7; 3.204, &#xA7; 3.205, &#xA7; 3.209, or &#xA7; 3.210 have not been met, the maximum annual rate of improved pension shall be determined without consideration of the claimed dependency. This amount shall be reduced by an amount which includes the income of the unestablished dependent. Adjustments in computation of the maximum annual rate of improved pension shall occur following receipt of evidence necessary to establish the dependency.

However, medical, legal or other expenses incident to the injury or death, or incident to the collection or recovery of the amount of the award or settlement, may be deducted. The criteria in &#xA7; 3.272(g) apply as to all medical expenditures after the award or settlement.

<P>(i) <I>Waiver of receipt of income.</I> Potential income that is not excludable under &#xA7; 3.272 or &#xA7; 3.279 but is waived by an individual is included as countable income of the individual. However, if an individual withdraws a claim for Social Security benefits, after a finding of entitlement to those benefits, in order to maintain eligibility for unreduced Social Security benefits upon reaching a particular age, VA will not regard this potential income as having been waived and will therefore not count it.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.274 Net worth and VA pension.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Net worth limit.</I> For purposes of entitlement to VA pension, the net worth limit effective October 18, 2018 is $123,600. This limit will be increased by the same percentage as the Social Security increase whenever there is a cost-of-living increase in benefit amounts payable under section 215(i) of title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)). VA will publish the current limit on its website at <I>www.benefits.va.gov/pension/.</I>
</P>
<P>(b) <I>When a claimant's or beneficiary's net worth exceeds the limit.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, VA will deny or discontinue pension if a claimant's or beneficiary's net worth exceeds the net worth limit in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Net worth.</I> Net worth means the sum of a claimant's or beneficiary's assets and annual income.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Asset calculation.</I> VA will calculate a claimant's or beneficiary's assets under this section and &#xA7; 3.275.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Annual income calculation.</I> VA will calculate a claimant's or beneficiary's annual income under &#xA7; 3.271, and will include the annual income of dependents as required by law. <I>See</I> &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.23(d)(4), 3.23(d)(5), and 3.24 for more information on annual income included when VA calculates a claimant's or beneficiary's pension entitlement rate. In calculating annual income for this purpose, VA will subtract all applicable deductible expenses, to include appropriate prospective medical expenses under &#xA7; 3.272(g).
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Example of net worth calculation.</I> For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit is $123,600. A claimant's assets total $117,000 and annual income is $9,000. Therefore, adding the claimant's annual income to assets produces net worth of $126,000. This amount exceeds the net worth limit.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Assets of other individuals included as claimant's or beneficiary's assets</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Claimant or beneficiary is a veteran.</I> A veteran's assets include the assets of the veteran as well as the assets of his or her spouse, if the veteran has a spouse.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Claimant or beneficiary is a surviving spouse.</I> A surviving spouse's assets include only the assets of the surviving spouse.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Claimant or beneficiary is a surviving child.</I> (i) If a surviving child has no custodian or is in the custody of an institution, the child's assets include only the assets of the child.
</P>
<P>(ii) If a surviving child has a custodian other than an institution, the child's assets include the assets of the child as well as the assets of the custodian. If the child is in the joint custody of his or her natural or adoptive parent and a stepparent, the child's assets also include the assets of the stepparent. <I>See</I> &#xA7; 3.57(d) for more information on child custody for pension purposes.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>How a child's net worth affects a veteran's or surviving spouse's pension entitlement.</I> VA will not consider a child to be a veteran's or surviving spouse's dependent child for pension purposes if the child's net worth exceeds the net worth limit in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Dependent child and potential dependent child.</I> For the purposes of this section&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) &#x201C;Dependent child&#x201D; refers to a child for whom a veteran or a surviving spouse is entitled to an increased maximum annual pension rate.
</P>
<P>(ii) &#x201C;Potential dependent child&#x201D; refers to a child who is excluded from a veteran's or surviving spouse's pension award solely or partly because of this paragraph (d). References in this section to &#x201C;dependent child&#x201D; include a potential dependent child.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Dependent child net worth.</I> A dependent child's net worth is the sum of his or her annual income and the value of his or her assets.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Dependent child asset calculation.</I> VA will calculate the value of a dependent child's assets under this section and &#xA7; 3.275. A dependent child's assets include the child's assets only.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Dependent child annual income calculation.</I> VA will calculate a dependent child's annual income under &#xA7; 3.271, and will include the annual income of the child as well as the annual income of the veteran or surviving spouse that would be included if VA were calculating a pension entitlement rate for the veteran or surviving spouse.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>When VA calculates net worth.</I> VA calculates net worth only when:
</P>
<P>(1) VA has received&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) An original pension claim;
</P>
<P>(ii) A new pension claim after a period of non-entitlement;
</P>
<P>(iii) A request to establish a new dependent; or
</P>
<P>(iv) Information that a veteran's, surviving spouse's, or child's net worth has increased or decreased; and
</P>
<P>(2) The claimant or beneficiary meets the other factors necessary for pension entitlement as provided in &#xA7; 3.3(a)(3) and (b)(4).
</P>
<NOTE>
<HED>Note to paragraph (<E T="01">e</E>):</HED>
<P>If the evidence shows that net worth exceeds the net worth limit, VA may decide the pension claim before determining if the claimant meets other entitlement factors. VA will notify the claimant of the entitlement factors that have not been established.</P></NOTE>
<P>(f) <I>How net worth decreases.</I> Net worth may decrease in three ways: Assets can decrease, annual income can decrease, or both assets and annual income can decrease.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>How assets decrease.</I> A veteran, surviving spouse, or child, or someone acting on their behalf, may decrease assets by spending them on any item or service for which fair market value is received unless the item or items purchased are themselves part of net worth. <I>See</I> &#xA7; 3.276(a)(4) for the definition of &#x201C;fair market value.&#x201D; The expenses must be those of the veteran, surviving spouse, or child, or a relative of the veteran, surviving spouse, or child. The relative must be a member or constructive member of the veteran's, surviving spouse's, or child's household.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>How annual income decreases. See</I> &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.271 through 3.273.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Example 1.</I> For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit is $123,600 and the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) is $12,000. A claimant has assets of $115,000 and annual income of $9,000. Adding annual income to assets produces a net worth of $124,000, which exceeds the net worth limit. However, the claimant is a patient in a nursing home and pays annual unreimbursed nursing home fees of $29,000. Reasonably predictable unreimbursed medical expenses are deductible from annual income under &#xA7; 3.272(g) to the extent that they exceed 5 percent of the applicable MAPR. VA subtracts the projected expenditures that exceed 5 percent of the applicable MAPR (here, $28,400) from annual income, which decreases annual income to zero. The claimant's net worth is now $115,000; therefore, net worth is within the limit to qualify for VA pension.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Example 2.</I> For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit is $123,600 and the MAPR is $12,000. A claimant has assets of $123,000 and annual income of $9,500. Adding annual income to assets produces a net worth of $132,500, which exceeds the net worth limit. The claimant pays reasonably predictable annual unreimbursed medical expenses of $9,000. Unreimbursed medical expenses are deductible from annual income under &#xA7; 3.272(g) to the extent that they exceed 5 percent of the applicable MAPR. VA subtracts the projected expenditures that exceed 5 percent of the applicable MAPR (here, $8,400) from annual income, which decreases annual income to $1,100. This decreases net worth to $124,100, which is still over the limit. VA must deny the claim for excessive net worth.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Effective dates of pension entitlement or increased entitlement after a denial, reduction, or discontinuance based on excessive net worth</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Scope of paragraph.</I> This paragraph (g) applies when VA has:
</P>
<P>(i) Discontinued pension or denied pension entitlement for a veteran, surviving spouse, or surviving child based on the veteran's, surviving spouse's, or surviving child's excessive net worth; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Reduced pension or denied increased pension entitlement for a veteran or surviving spouse based on a dependent child's excessive net worth.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Effective date of entitlement or increased entitlement.</I> The effective date of entitlement or increased entitlement is the day net worth ceases to exceed the limit. For this effective date to apply, the claimant or beneficiary must submit a certified statement that net worth has decreased and VA must receive the certified statement before the pension claim has become finally adjudicated under &#xA7; 3.160. This means that VA must receive the certified statement within 1 year after its decision notice to the claimant concerning the denial, reduction, or discontinuance unless the claimant appeals VA's decision. Otherwise, the effective date is the date VA receives a new pension claim. In accordance with &#xA7; 3.277(a), VA may require the claimant or beneficiary to submit additional evidence as the individual circumstances may require.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Reduction or discontinuance of beneficiary's pension entitlement based on excessive net worth</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Effective date of reduction or discontinuance.</I> When an increase in a beneficiary's or dependent child's net worth results in a pension reduction or discontinuance because net worth exceeds the limit, the effective date of reduction or discontinuance is the last day of the calendar year in which net worth exceeds the limit.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Net worth decreases before the effective date.</I> If net worth decreases to the limit or below the limit before the effective date provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, VA will not reduce or discontinue the pension award on the basis of excessive net worth.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Additional effective-date provisions for dependent children</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Establishing a dependent child on veteran's or surviving spouse's pension award results in increased pension entitlement.</I> When establishing a dependent child on a veteran's or surviving spouse's pension award results in increased pension entitlement for the veteran or surviving spouse, VA will apply the effective-date provisions in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Establishing a dependent child on veteran's or surviving spouse's pension award results in decreased pension entitlement.</I> (i) When a dependent child's non-excessive net worth results in decreased pension entitlement for the veteran or surviving spouse, the effective date of the decreased pension entitlement rate (<I>i.e.,</I> VA action to add the child to the award) is the end of the year that the child's net worth decreases.
</P>
<P>(ii) When a dependent child's excessive net worth results in increased pension entitlement for the veteran or surviving spouse, the effective date of the increased pension entitlement rate (<I>i.e.,</I> VA action to remove the child from the award) is the date that VA receives a claim for an increased rate based on the child's net worth increase.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.275 How VA determines the asset amount for pension net worth determinations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions pertaining to assets</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Assets.</I> The term <I>assets</I> means the fair market value of all property that an individual owns, including all real and personal property, unless excluded under paragraph (b) of this section, less the amount of mortgages or other encumbrances specific to the mortgaged or encumbered property. VA will consider the terms of the recorded deed or other evidence of title to be proof of ownership of a particular asset. <I>See also</I> &#xA7; 3.276(a)(4), which defines &#x201C;fair market value.&#x201D;
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Claimant.</I> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, for the purposes of this section and &#xA7; 3.276, <I>claimant</I> means a pension beneficiary, a dependent spouse, or a dependent or potential dependent child as described in &#xA7; 3.274(d), as well as a veteran, surviving spouse, or surviving child pension applicant.
</P>
<P>(ii) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, <I>claimant</I> means a pension beneficiary or applicant who is a veteran, a surviving spouse, or a surviving child.

</P>
<P>(1) <I>Primary residence.</I> The value of a claimant's primary residence (single-family unit), including the residential lot area, in which the claimant has an ownership interest. VA recognizes one primary residence per claimant. If the residence is sold after pension entitlement is established, any net proceeds from the sale is an asset except to the extent the proceeds are used to purchase another residence within the same calendar year as the year in which the sale occurred.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Personal mortgage not deductible.</I> VA will not subtract from a claimant's assets the amount of any mortgages or encumbrances on a claimant's primary residence.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Claimant not residing in primary residence.</I> Although rental income counts as annual income as provided in &#xA7; 3.271(d), VA will not include a claimant's primary residence as an asset even if the claimant resides in any of the following as defined in &#xA7; 3.278(b):
</P>
<P>(A) A nursing home or medical foster home;
</P>
<P>(B) A care facility other than a nursing home; or
</P>
<P>(C) The home of a family member for health care or custodial care.</P>

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.276 Asset transfers and penalty periods.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Asset transfer definitions.</I> For purposes of this section&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Claimant</I> has the same meaning as defined in &#xA7; 3.275(a)(2)(i).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Covered asset</I> means an asset that&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) Was part of a claimant's net worth;
</P>
<P>(ii) Was transferred for less than fair market value; and
</P>
<P>(iii) If not transferred, would have caused or partially caused the claimant's net worth to exceed the net worth limit under &#xA7; 3.274(a).
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Covered asset amount</I> means the monetary amount by which a claimant's net worth would have exceeded the limit due to the covered asset alone if the uncompensated value of the covered asset had been included in net worth.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Example 1.</I> For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit under &#xA7; 3.274(a) is $123,600. A claimant's assets total $115,900 and his annual income is zero. However, the claimant transferred $30,000 by giving it to a friend. If the claimant had not transferred the $30,000, his net worth would have been $145,900, which exceeds the net worth limit. The claimant's covered asset amount is $22,300, because this is the amount by which the claimant's net worth would have exceeded the limit due to the covered asset.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Example 2.</I> For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit under &#xA7; 3.274(a) is $123,600. A claimant's annual income is zero and her total assets are $125,000, which exceeds the net worth limit. In addition, the claimant transferred $30,000 by giving $20,000 to her married son and giving $10,000 to a friend. The claimant's covered asset amount is $30,000 because this is the amount by which the claimant's net worth would have exceeded the limit due to the covered assets alone.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Fair market value</I> means the price at which an asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. VA will use the best available information to determine fair market value, such as inspections, appraisals, public records, and the market value of similar property if applicable.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Transfer for less than fair market value</I> means&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) Selling, conveying, gifting, or exchanging an asset for an amount less than the fair market value of the asset; or
</P>
<P>(ii) A voluntary asset transfer to, or purchase of, any financial instrument or investment that reduces net worth by transferring the asset to, or purchasing, the instrument or investment unless the claimant establishes that he or she has the ability to liquidate the entire balance of the asset for the claimant's own benefit. If the claimant establishes that the asset can be liquidated, the asset is included as net worth. Examples of such instruments or investments include&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Annuities. Annuity</I> means a financial instrument that provides income over a defined period of time for an initial payment of principal.
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Trusts. Trust</I> means a legal instrument by which an individual (the grantor) transfers property to an individual or an entity (the trustee), who manages the property according to the terms of the trust, whether for the grantor's own benefit or for the benefit of another individual.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Uncompensated value</I> means the difference between the fair market value of an asset and the amount of compensation an individual receives for it. In the case of a trust, annuity, or other financial instrument or investment described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, <I>uncompensated value</I> means the amount of money or the monetary value of any other type of asset transferred to such a trust, annuity, or other financial instrument or investment.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Look-back period</I> means the 36-month period immediately preceding the date on which VA receives either an original pension claim or a new pension claim after a period of non-entitlement. This definition does not include any date before October 18, 2018.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Penalty period</I> means a period of non-entitlement, calculated under paragraph (e) of this section, due to transfer of a covered asset.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>General statement of policy pertaining to pension and covered assets.</I> VA pension is a needs-based benefit and is not intended to preserve the estates of individuals who have the means to support themselves. Accordingly, a claimant may not create pension entitlement by transferring covered assets. VA will review the terms and conditions of asset transfers made during the 36-month look-back period to determine whether the transfer constituted transfer of a covered asset. However, VA will disregard asset transfers made before October 18, 2018. In accordance with &#xA7; 3.277(a), for any asset transfer, VA may require a claimant to provide evidence such as a Federal income tax return transcript, the terms of a gift, trust, or annuity, or the terms of a recorded deed or other evidence of title.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Exception for transfers as a result of fraud or unfair business practice.</I> An asset transferred as the result of fraud, misrepresentation, or unfair business practice related to the sale or marketing of financial products or services for purposes of establishing entitlement to VA pension will not be considered a covered asset. Evidence supporting this exception may include, but is not limited to, a complaint contemporaneously filed with State, local, or Federal authorities reporting the incident.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Exception for transfers to certain trusts.</I> VA will not consider as a covered asset an asset that a veteran, a veteran's spouse, or a veteran's surviving spouse transfers to a trust established on behalf of a child of the veteran if:
</P>
<P>(1) VA rates or has rated the child incapable of self-support under &#xA7; 3.356; and
</P>
<P>(2) There is no circumstance under which distributions from the trust can be used to benefit the veteran, the veteran's spouse, or the veteran's surviving spouse.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Penalty periods and calculations.</I> When a claimant transfers a covered asset during the look-back period, VA will assess a penalty period not to exceed 5 years. VA will calculate the length of the penalty period by dividing the total covered asset amount by the monthly penalty rate described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and rounding the quotient down to the nearest whole number. The result is the number of months for which VA will not pay pension.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Monthly penalty rate.</I> The monthly penalty rate is the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) under 38 U.S.C. 1521(d)(2) for a veteran in need of aid and attendance with one dependent that is in effect as of the date of the pension claim, divided by 12, and rounded down to the nearest whole dollar. The monthly penalty rate is located on VA's website at <I>www.benefits.va.gov/pension.</I>
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Beginning date of penalty period.</I> When a claimant transfers a covered asset or assets during the look-back period, the penalty period begins on the first day of the month that follows the date of the transfer. If there was more than one transfer, the penalty period will begin on the first day of the month that follows the date of the last transfer.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Entitlement upon ending of penalty period.</I> VA will consider that the claimant, if otherwise qualified, is entitled to benefits effective the last day of the last month of the penalty period, with a payment date as of the first day of the following month in accordance with &#xA7; 3.31.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Example of penalty period calculation.</I> VA receives a pension claim in November 2018. The claimant's net worth is equal to the net worth limit. However, the claimant transferred covered assets totaling $10,000 on August 20, 2018, and September 23, 2018. Therefore, the total covered asset amount is $10,000, and the penalty period begins on October 1, 2018. Assume the MAPR for a veteran in need of aid and attendance with one dependent in effect in November 2018 is $24,000. The monthly penalty rate is $2,000. The penalty period is $10,000/$2,000 per month = 5 months. The fifth month of the penalty period is February 2019. The claimant may be entitled to pension effective February 28, 2019, with a payment date of March 1, 2019, if other entitlement requirements are met.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Penalty period recalculations.</I> VA will not recalculate a penalty period under this section unless&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) The original calculation is shown to be erroneous; or
</P>
<P>(ii) VA receives evidence showing that some or all covered assets were returned to the claimant before the date of claim or within 60 days after the date of VA's notice to the claimant of VA's decision concerning the penalty period. If covered assets are returned to the claimant, VA will recalculate or eliminate the penalty period. For this exception to apply, VA must receive the evidence not later than 90 days after the date of VA's notice to the claimant of VA's decision concerning the penalty period. Once covered assets are returned, a claimant may reduce net worth at the time of transfer under the provisions of &#xA7; 3.274(f).

</P>
<P>(2) The Secretary may require an eligibility verification report under the following circumstances:

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.278 Deductible medical expenses.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Scope.</I> This section identifies medical expenses that VA may deduct from countable income for purposes of three of its needs-based programs: Pension, section 306 pension, and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC). Payments for such medical expenses must be unreimbursed to be deductible from income.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> For the purposes of this section&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Health care provider</I> means:
</P>
<P>(i) An individual licensed by a State or country to provide health care in the State or country in which the individual provides the health care. The term includes, but is not limited to, a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, chiropractor, registered nurse, licensed vocational nurse, licensed practical nurse, and physical or occupational therapist; or
</P>
<P>(ii) A nursing assistant or home health aide who is supervised by a licensed health care provider as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Activities of daily living (ADLs)</I> mean basic self-care activities and consist of bathing or showering, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring, and ambulating within the home or living area. <I>Transferring</I> means an individual's moving himself or herself from one position to another, such as getting in and out of bed.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)</I> mean independent living activities, such as shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundering, managing finances, handling medications, using the telephone, and transportation for non-medical purposes.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Custodial care</I> means regular:
</P>
<P>(i) Assistance with two or more ADLs; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Supervision because an individual with a physical, mental, developmental, or cognitive disorder requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the individual from hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Nursing home</I> means a facility defined in &#xA7; 3.1(z)(1) or (2). If the facility is not located in a State, the facility must be licensed in the country in which it is located.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Medical foster home</I> means a privately-owned residence, recognized and approved by VA under 38 CFR 17.73(d), that offers a non-institutional alternative to nursing home care for veterans who are unable to live alone safely due to chronic or terminal illness.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Care facility other than a nursing home</I> means a facility in which a disabled individual receives health care or custodial care under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. A facility must be licensed if facilities of that type are required to be licensed in the State or country in which the facility is located. A facility that is residential must be staffed 24 hours per day with care providers. The providers do not have to be licensed health care providers.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Needs A&amp;A or is housebound</I> refers to a disabled individual who meets the criteria in &#xA7; 3.351 for needing regular aid and attendance (A&amp;A) or being housebound and is a:
</P>
<P>(i) Veteran;
</P>
<P>(ii) Surviving spouse;
</P>
<P>(iii) Parent (for parents' DIC purposes); or
</P>
<P>(iv) Spouse of a living veteran with a service-connected disability rated at least 30 percent disabling, who is receiving pension.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Medical expenses for VA purposes.</I> Generally, medical expenses for VA needs-based benefit purposes are payments for items or services that are medically necessary; that improve a disabled individual's functioning; or that prevent, slow, or ease an individual's functional decline. Medical expenses may include, but are not limited to, the payments specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Care by a health care provider.</I> Payments to a health care provider for services performed within the scope of the provider's professional capacity are medical expenses. Cosmetic procedures that a health care provider performs to improve a congenital or accidental deformity or related to treatment for a diagnosed medical condition are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Medications, medical supplies, medical equipment, and medical food, vitamins, and supplements.</I> Payments for prescription and non-prescription medication procured lawfully under Federal law, as well as payments for medical supplies or medical equipment, are medical expenses. Medically necessary food, vitamins, and supplements as prescribed or directed by a health care provider authorized to write prescriptions are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Adaptive equipment.</I> Payments for adaptive devices or service animals, including veterinary care, used to assist a person with an ongoing disability are medical expenses. Medical expenses do not include non-prescription food, boarding, grooming, or other routine expenses of owning an animal.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Transportation expenses.</I> Payments for transportation for medical purposes, such as the cost of transportation to and from a health care provider's office by taxi, bus, or other form of public transportation are medical expenses. The cost of transportation for medical purposes by privately owned vehicle (POV), including mileage, parking, and tolls, is a medical expense. For transportation in a POV, VA limits the deductible mileage rate to the current POV mileage reimbursement rate specified by the United States General Services Administration (GSA). The current amount can be obtained from <I>www.gsa.gov</I> or on VA's website at <I>www.benefits.va.gov/pension/.</I> Amounts by which transportation expenses set forth in this paragraph (c)(4) exceed the amounts of other VA or non-VA reimbursements for the expense are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Example.</I> In February 2013, a veteran drives 60 miles round trip to a VA medical center and back. The veteran is reimbursed $24.90 from the Veterans Health Administration. The POV mileage reimbursement rate specified by GSA is $0.565 per mile, so the transportation expense is $0.565/mile * 60 miles = $33.90. For VA needs-based benefits purposes, the unreimbursed amount, here, the difference between $33.90 and $24.90, is a medical expense.
</P>
<P>(ii) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Health insurance premiums.</I> Payments for health, medical, hospitalization, and long-term care insurance premiums are medical expenses. Premiums for Medicare Parts A, B, and D and for long-term care insurance are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Smoking cessation products.</I> Payments for items and services specifically related to smoking cessation are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Institutional forms of care and in-home care.</I> As provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Institutional forms of care and in-home care.</I> This paragraph (d) applies with respect to claims for a medical expense deduction for institutional forms of care or in-home care received on or after October 18, 2018 that VA has not previously granted.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Hospitals, nursing homes, medical foster homes, and inpatient treatment centers.</I> Payments to hospitals, nursing homes, medical foster homes, and inpatient treatment centers (including inpatient treatment centers for drug or alcohol addiction), including the cost of meals and lodging charged by such facilities, are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>In-home care.</I> Payments for assistance with ADLs and IADLs by an in-home attendant are medical expenses as long as the attendant provides the disabled individual with health care or custodial care. Payments must be commensurate with the number of hours that the provider attends to the disabled person. The attendant must be a health care provider unless&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) The disabled individual needs A&amp;A or is housebound; or
</P>
<P>(ii) A physician, physician assistant, certified nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist states in writing that, due to a physical, mental, developmental, or cognitive disorder, the individual requires the health care or custodial care that the in-home attendant provides.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Care facilities other than nursing homes.</I> (i) Care in a facility may be provided by the facility, contracted by the facility, obtained from a third-party provider, or provided by family or friends.
</P>
<P>(ii) Payments for health care provided by a health care provider are medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(iii) The provider does not need to be a health care provider, and payments for assistance with ADLs and IADLs are medical expenses, if the disabled individual is receiving health care or custodial care in the facility and&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(A) The disabled individual needs A&amp;A or is housebound; or
</P>
<P>(B) A physician, physician assistant, certified nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist states in writing that, due to a physical, mental, developmental, or cognitive disorder, the individual needs to be in a protected environment.
</P>
<P>(iv) Payments for meals and lodging (and other facility expenses not directly related to health care or custodial care) are medical expenses if:
</P>
<P>(A) The facility provides or contracts for health care or custodial care for the disabled individual; or
</P>
<P>(B) A physician, physician assistant, certified nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist states in writing that the individual must reside in the facility (or a similar facility) to separately contract with a third-party provider to receive health care or custodial care or to receive (paid or unpaid) health care or custodial care from family or friends.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Non-medical expenses for VA purposes.</I> Payments for items and services listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section are not medical expenses for VA needs-based benefit purposes. The list is not all-inclusive.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Maintenance of general health.</I> Payments for items or services that benefit or maintain general health, such as vacations and dance classes, are not medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Cosmetic procedures.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, cosmetic procedures are not medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Meals and lodging.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, payments for meals and lodging are not medical expenses.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Assistance with IADLs.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, payments for assistance with IADLs are not medical expenses.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.279 Statutory exclusions from income or assets (net worth or corpus of the estate).</HEAD>
<P>This section sets forth payments that Federal statutes exclude from income for the purpose of determining entitlement to any VA-administered benefit that is based on financial need. Some of the exclusions also apply to assets (pension), also known as net worth or the corpus of the estate (section 306 pension and parents as dependents for compensation). VA will exclude from income or assets any amount designated by statute as not countable as income or resources, regardless of whether or not it is listed in this section.

<P>(a) For claims received by VA after June 9, 1998, a disability or death will not be considered service-connected on the basis that it resulted from injury or disease attributable to the veteran's use of tobacco products during service. For the purpose of this section, the term &#x201C;tobacco products&#x201D; means cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco.

</P>
<P>(1) The disability or death resulted from a disease or injury that is otherwise shown to have been incurred or aggravated during service. For purposes of this section, &#x201C;otherwise shown&#x201D; means that the disability or death can be service-connected on some basis other than the veteran's use of tobacco products during service, or that the disability became manifest or death occurred during service; or

<P>(1) <I>Venereal disease.</I> The residuals of venereal disease are not to be considered the result of willful misconduct. Consideration of service connection for residuals of venereal disease as having been incurred in service requires that the initial infection must have occurred during active service. Increase in service of manifestations of venereal disease will usually be held due to natural progress unless the facts of record indicate the increase in manifestations was precipitated by trauma or by the conditions of the veteran's service, in which event service connection may be established by aggravation. Medical principles pertaining to the incubation period and its relation to the course of the disease; <I>i.e.</I>, initial or acute manifestation, or period and course of secondary and late residuals manifested, will be considered when time of incurrence of venereal disease prior to or after entry into service is at issue. In the issue of service connection, whether the veteran complied with service regulations and directives for reporting the disease and undergoing treatment is immaterial after November 14, 1972, and the service department characterization of acquisition of the disease as <I>willful misconduct</I> or as <I>not in line of duty</I> will not govern.
</P>
<P>(2) The simple drinking of alcoholic beverage is not of itself willful misconduct. The deliberate drinking of a known poisonous substance or under conditions which would raise a presumption to that effect will be considered willful misconduct. If, in the drinking of a beverage to enjoy its intoxicating effects, intoxication results proximately and immediately in disability or death, the disability or death will be considered the result of the person's willful misconduct. Organic diseases and disabilities which are a secondary result of the chronic use of alcohol as a beverage, whether out of compulsion or otherwise, will not be considered of willful misconduct origin.

Organic diseases and disabilities which are a secondary result of the chronic use of drugs and infections coinciding with the injection of drugs will not be considered of willful misconduct origin. (See paragraph (d) of this section regarding service connection where disability or death is a result of abuse of drugs.) Where drugs are used for therapeutic purposes or where use of drugs or addiction thereto, results from a service-connected disability, it will not be considered of misconduct origin.

For the purpose of this paragraph, alcohol abuse means the use of alcoholic beverages over time, or such excessive use at any one time, sufficient to cause disability to or death of the user; drug abuse means the use of illegal drugs (including prescription drugs that are illegally or illicitly obtained), the intentional use of prescription or non-prescription drugs for a purpose other than the medically intended use, or the use of substances other than alcohol to enjoy their intoxicating effects.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.302 Service connection for mental unsoundness in suicide.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> (1) In order for suicide to constitute willful misconduct, the act of self-destruction must be intentional.
</P>
<P>(2) A person of unsound mind is incapable of forming an intent (mens rea, or guilty mind, which is an essential element of crime or willful misconduct).
</P>
<P>(3) It is a constant requirement for favorable action that the precipitating mental unsoundness be service connected.

<P>(b) <I>Evidence of mental condition.</I> (1) Whether a person, at the time of suicide, was so unsound mentally that he or she did not realize the consequence of such an act, or was unable to resist such impulse is a question to be determined in each individual case, based on all available lay and medical evidence pertaining to his or her mental condition at the time of suicide.
</P>
<P>(2) The act of suicide or a bona fide attempt is considered to be evidence of mental unsoundness. Therefore, where no reasonable adequate motive for suicide is shown by the evidence, the act will be considered to have resulted from mental unsoundness.
</P>
<P>(3) A reasonable adequate motive for suicide may be established by affirmative evidence showing circumstances which could lead a rational person to self-destruction.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Evaluation of evidence.</I> (1) Affirmative evidence is necessary to justify reversal of service department findings of mental unsoundness where Department of Veterans Affairs criteria do not otherwise warrant contrary findings.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.303 Principles relating to service connection.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service or through the application of statutory presumptions. Each disabling condition shown by a veteran's service records, or for which he seeks a service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types and circumstances of his service as shown by service records, the official history of each organization in which he served, his medical records and all pertinent medical and lay evidence. Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, with due consideration to the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Chronicity and continuity.</I> With chronic disease shown as such in service (or within the presumptive period under &#xA7; 3.307) so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. This rule does not mean that any manifestation of joint pain, any abnormality of heart action or heart sounds, any urinary findings of casts, or any cough, in service will permit service connection of arthritis, disease of the heart, nephritis, or pulmonary disease, first shown as a clearcut clinical entity, at some later date. For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word &#x201C;Chronic.&#x201D; When the disease identity is established (leprosy, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity. Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Preservice disabilities noted in service.</I> There are medical principles so universally recognized as to constitute fact (clear and unmistakable proof), and when in accordance with these principles existence of a disability prior to service is established, no additional or confirmatory evidence is necessary. Consequently with notation or discovery during service of such residual conditions (scars; fibrosis of the lungs; atrophies following disease of the central or peripheral nervous system; healed fractures; absent, displaced or resected parts of organs; supernumerary parts; congenital malformations or hemorrhoidal tags or tabs, etc.) with no evidence of the pertinent antecedent active disease or injury during service the conclusion must be that they preexisted service. Similarly, manifestation of lesions or symptoms of chronic disease from date of enlistment, or so close thereto that the disease could not have originated in so short a period will establish preservice existence thereof. Conditions of an infectious nature are to be considered with regard to the circumstances of the infection and if manifested in less than the respective incubation periods after reporting for duty, they will be held to have preexisted service. In the field of mental disorders, personality disorders which are characterized by developmental defects or pathological trends in the personality structure manifested by a lifelong pattern of action or behavior, chronic psychoneurosis of long duration or other psychiatric symptomatology shown to have existed prior to service with the same manifestations during service, which were the basis of the service diagnosis, will be accepted as showing preservice origin. Congenital or developmental defects, refractive error of the eye, personality disorders and mental deficiency as such are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Postservice initial diagnosis of disease.</I> Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. Presumptive periods are not intended to limit service connection to diseases so diagnosed when the evidence warrants direct service connection. The presumptive provisions of the statute and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations implementing them are intended as liberalizations applicable when the evidence would not warrant service connection without their aid.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.304 Direct service connection; wartime and peacetime.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The basic considerations relating to service connection are stated in &#xA7; 3.303. The criteria in this section apply only to disabilities which may have resulted from service in a period of war or service rendered on or after January 1, 1947.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Presumption of soundness.</I> The veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service. Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1111)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(1) History of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions but will be considered together with all other material evidence in determinations as to inception. Determinations should not be based on medical judgment alone as distinguished from accepted medical principles, or on history alone without regard to clinical factors pertinent to the basic character, origin and development of such injury or disease. They should be based on thorough analysis of the evidentiary showing and careful correlation of all material facts, with due regard to accepted medical principles pertaining to the history, manifestations, clinical course, and character of the particular injury or disease or residuals thereof.
</P>
<P>(2) History conforming to accepted medical principles should be given due consideration, in conjunction with basic clinical data, and be accorded probative value consistent with accepted medical and evidentiary principles in relation to value consistent with accepted medical evidence relating to incurrence, symptoms and course of the injury or disease, including official and other records made prior to, during or subsequent to service, together with all other lay and medical evidence concerning the inception, development and manifestations of the particular condition will be taken into full account.
</P>
<P>(3) Signed statements of veterans relating to the origin, or incurrence of any disease or injury made in service if against his or her own interest is of no force and effect if other data do not establish the fact. Other evidence will be considered as though such statement were not of record.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1219)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(c) <I>Development.</I> The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination. In initially rating disability of record at the time of discharge, the records of the service department, including the reports of examination at enlistment and the clinical records during service, will ordinarily suffice. Rating of combat injuries or other conditions which obviously had their inception in service may be accomplished pending receipt of copy of the examination at enlistment and all other service records.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Combat.</I> Satisfactory lay or other evidence that an injury or disease was incurred or aggravated in combat will be accepted as sufficient proof of service connection if the evidence is consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service even though there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1154(b))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(e) <I>Prisoners of war.</I> Where disability compensation is claimed by a former prisoner of war, omission of history or findings from clinical records made upon repatriation is not determinative of service connection, particularly if evidence of comrades in support of the incurrence of the disability during confinement is available. Special attention will be given to any disability first reported after discharge, especially if poorly defined and not obviously of intercurrent origin. The circumstances attendant upon the individual veteran's confinement and the duration thereof will be associated with pertinent medical principles in determining whether disability manifested subsequent to service is etiologically related to the prisoner of war experience.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</I> Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with &#xA7; 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. The following provisions apply to claims for service connection of posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosed during service or based on the specified type of claimed stressor:
</P>
<P>(1) If the evidence establishes a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder during service and the claimed stressor is related to that service, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
</P>
<P>(2) If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
</P>
<P>(3) If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor. For purposes of this paragraph, &#x201C;fear of hostile military or terrorist activity&#x201D; means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.
</P>
<P>(4) If the evidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner-of-war under the provisions of &#xA7; 3.1(y) of this part and the claimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war experience, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
</P>
<P>(5) If a posttraumatic stress disorder claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident. Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy. Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources. Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes. VA will not deny a posttraumatic stress disorder claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence. VA may submit any evidence that it receives to an appropriate medical or mental health professional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a personal assault occurred.

<P>(b) <I>Presumption of soundness.</I> A peacetime veteran who has had active, continuous service of 6 months or more will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities or disorders noted at the time thereof, or where evidence or medical judgment, as distinguished from medical fact and principles, establishes that an injury or disease preexisted service. Any evidence acceptable as competent to indicate the time of existence or inception of the condition may be considered. Determinations based on medical judgment will take cognizance of the time of inception or manifestation of disease or injury following entrance into service, as shown by proper service authorities in service records, entries or reports. Such records will be accorded reasonable weight in consideration of other evidence and sound medical reasoning. Opinions may be solicited from Department of Veterans Affairs medical authorities when considered necessary.

<P>(c) <I>Campaigns and expeditions.</I> In considering claims of veterans who engaged in combat during campaigns or expeditions satisfactory lay or other evidence of incurrence or aggravation in such combat of an injury or disease, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service will be accepted as sufficient proof of service connection, even when there is no official record of incurrence or aggravation. Service connection for such injury or disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.307 Presumptive service connection for chronic, tropical, or prisoner-of-war related disease, disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, or disease associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune; wartime and service on or after January 1, 1947.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> A chronic, tropical, or prisoner of war related disease, a disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, or a disease associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune listed in &#xA7; 3.309 will be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by service under the circumstances outlined in this section even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. No condition other than one listed in &#xA7; 3.309(a) will be considered chronic.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Service.</I> The veteran must have served 90 days or more during a war period or after December 31, 1946. The requirement of 90 days' service means active, continuous service within or extending into or beyond a war period, or which began before and extended beyond December 31, 1946, or began after that date. Any period of service is sufficient for the purpose of establishing the presumptive service connection of a specified disease under the conditions listed in &#xA7; 3.309(c) and (e). Any period of service is sufficient for the purpose of establishing the presumptive service connection of a specified disease under the conditions listed in &#xA7; 3.309(f), as long as the period of service also satisfies the requirements to establish a presumption of exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune under paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Separation from service.</I> For the purpose of paragraph (a)(3) and (4) of this section the date of separation from wartime service will be the date of discharge or release during a war period, or if service continued after the war, the end of the war period. In claims based on service on or after January 1, 1947, the date of separation will be the date of discharge or release from the period of service on which the claim is based.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Chronic disease.</I> The disease must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year (for Hansen's disease (leprosy) and tuberculosis, within 3 years; multiple sclerosis, within 7 years) from the date of separation from service as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Tropical disease.</I> The disease must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year from date of separation from service as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or at a time when standard accepted treatises indicate that the incubation period commenced during such service. The resultant disorders or diseases originating because of therapy administered in connection with a tropical disease or as a preventative may also be service connected.

</PARAUTH>
<P>(6) <I>Diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents.</I> (i) For the purposes of this section, the term &#x201C;herbicide agent&#x201D; means a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, specifically: 2,4&#x2013;D; 2,4,5&#x2013;T and its contaminant TCDD; cacodylic acid; and picloram.

<P>(ii) The diseases listed at &#xA7; 3.309(e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service, except that chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, and early-onset peripheral neuropathy shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service.
</P>
<P>(iii) A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. The last date on which such a veteran shall be presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent shall be the last date on which he or she served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975. &#x201C;Service in the Republic of Vietnam&#x201D; includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>(iv) A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that, as determined by the Department of Defense, operated in or near the Korean DMZ in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. <I>See also</I> 38 CFR 3.814(c)(2).
</P>
<P>(v) An individual who performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve under circumstances in which the individual concerned regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C&#x2013;123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent during the Vietnam era shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent. For purposes of this paragraph, &#x201C;regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C&#x2013;123 aircraft&#x201D; means that the individual was assigned to an Air Force or Air Force Reserve squadron when the squadron was permanently assigned one of the affected aircraft and the individual had an Air Force Specialty Code indicating duties as a flight, ground maintenance, or medical crew member on such aircraft. Such exposure constitutes an injury under 38 U.S.C. 101(24)(B) and (C). If an individual described in this paragraph develops a disease listed in 38 CFR 3.309(e) as specified in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, it will be presumed that the individual concerned became disabled during that service for purposes of establishing that the individual served in the active military, naval, or air service.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Diseases associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.</I> (i) For the purposes of this section, <I>contaminants in the water supply</I> means the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), benzene and vinyl chloride, that were in the on-base water-supply systems located at United States Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987.
</P>
<P>(ii) The diseases listed in &#xA7; 3.309(f) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service.
</P>
<P>(iii) A veteran, or former reservist or member of the National Guard, who had no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of service at Camp Lejeune during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to the contaminants in the water supply, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the individual was not exposed to contaminants in the water supply during that service. The last date on which such a veteran, or former reservist or member of the National Guard, shall be presumed to have been exposed to contaminants in the water supply shall be the last date on which he or she served at Camp Lejeune during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987. For purposes of this section, <I>service at Camp Lejeune</I> means any service within the borders of the entirety of the United States Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina, during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987, as established by military orders or other official service department records.
</P>
<P>(iv) Exposure described in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section is an injury under 38 U.S.C. 101(24)(B) and (C). If an individual described in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section develops a disease listed in &#xA7; 3.309(f), VA will presume that the individual concerned became disabled during that service for purposes of establishing that the individual served in the active military, naval, or air service.

</PARAUTH>
<P>(b) <I>Evidentiary basis.</I> The factual basis may be established by medical evidence, competent lay evidence or both. Medical evidence should set forth the physical findings and symptomatology elicited by examination within the applicable period. Lay evidence should describe the material and relevant facts as to the veteran's disability observed within such period, not merely conclusions based upon opinion. The chronicity and continuity factors outlined in &#xA7; 3.303(b) will be considered. The diseases listed in &#xA7; 3.309(a) will be accepted as chronic, even though diagnosed as acute because of insidious inception and chronic development, except: (1) Where they result from intercurrent causes, for example, cerebral hemorrhage due to injury, or active nephritis or acute endocarditis due to intercurrent infection (with or without identification of the pathogenic micro-organism); or (2) where a disease is the result of drug ingestion or a complication of some other condition not related to service. Thus, leukemia will be accepted as a chronic disease whether diagnosed as acute or chronic. Unless the clinical picture is clear otherwise, consideration will be given as to whether an acute condition is an exacerbation of a chronic disease.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1112)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(c) <I>Prohibition of certain presumptions.</I> No presumptions may be invoked on the basis of advancement of the disease when first definitely diagnosed for the purpose of showing its existence to a degree of 10 percent within the applicable period. This will not be interpreted as requiring that the disease be diagnosed in the presumptive period, but only that there be then shown by acceptable medical or lay evidence characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree, followed without unreasonable time lapse by definite diagnosis. Symptomatology shown in the prescribed period may have no particular significance when first observed, but in the light of subsequent developments it may gain considerable significance. Cases in which a chronic condition is shown to exist within a short time following the applicable presumptive period, but without evidence of manifestations within the period, should be developed to determine whether there was symptomatology which in retrospect may be identified and evaluated as manifestation of the chronic disease to the required 10-percent degree.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Rebuttal of service incurrence or aggravation.</I> (1) Evidence which may be considered in rebuttal of service incurrence of a disease listed in &#xA7; 3.309 will be any evidence of a nature usually accepted as competent to indicate the time of existence or inception of disease, and medical judgment will be exercised in making determinations relative to the effect of intercurrent injury or disease. The expression &#x201C;affirmative evidence to the contrary&#x201D; will not be taken to require a conclusive showing, but such showing as would, in sound medical reasoning and in the consideration of all evidence of record, support a conclusion that the disease was not incurred in service. As to tropical diseases the fact that the veteran had no service in a locality having a high incidence of the disease may be considered as evidence to rebut the presumption, as may residence during the period in question in a region where the particular disease is endemic. The known incubation periods of tropical diseases should be used as a factor in rebuttal of presumptive service connection as showing inception before or after service.
</P>
<P>(2) The presumption of aggravation provided in this section may be rebutted by affirmative evidence that the preexisting condition was not aggravated by service, which may include affirmative evidence that any increase in disability was due to an intercurrent disease or injury suffered after separation from service or evidence sufficient, under &#xA7; 3.306 of this part, to show that the increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.

<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Except as provided in &#xA7; 3.300(c), disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected. When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition.

<P>(b) <I>Aggravation of nonservice-connected disabilities.</I> Any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease, will be service connected. However, VA will not concede that a nonservice-connected disease or injury was aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury unless the baseline level of severity of the nonservice-connected disease or injury is established by medical evidence created before the onset of aggravation or by the earliest medical evidence created at any time between the onset of aggravation and the receipt of medical evidence establishing the current level of severity of the nonservice-connected disease or injury. The rating activity will determine the baseline and current levels of severity under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR part 4) and determine the extent of aggravation by deducting the baseline level of severity, as well as any increase in severity due to the natural progress of the disease, from the current level.

<P>(a) <I>Determinations of exposure and dose</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Dose assessment.</I> In all claims in which it is established that a radiogenic disease first became manifest after service and was not manifest to a compensable degree within any applicable presumptive period as specified in &#xA7; 3.307 or &#xA7; 3.309, and it is contended the disease is a result of exposure to ionizing radiation in service, an assessment will be made as to the size and nature of the radiation dose or doses. When dose estimates provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section are reported as a range of doses to which a veteran may have been exposed, exposure at the highest level of the dose range reported will be presumed.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(2) <I>Request for dose information.</I> Where necessary pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, dose information will be requested as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Atmospheric nuclear weapons test participation claims.</I> In claims based upon participation in atmospheric nuclear testing, dose data will in all cases be requested from the appropriate office of the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Hiroshima and Nagasaki occupation claims.</I> In all claims based on participation in the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, prior to July 1, 1946, dose data will be requested from the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Other exposure claims.</I> In all other claims involving radiation exposure, a request will be made for any available records concerning the veteran's exposure to radiation. These records normally include but may not be limited to the veteran's Record of Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation (DD Form 1141), if maintained, service medical records, and other records which may contain information pertaining to the veteran's radiation dose in service. All such records will be forwarded to the Under Secretary for Health, who will be responsible for preparation of a dose estimate, to the extent feasible, based on available methodologies.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Referral to independent expert.</I> When necessary to reconcile a material difference between an estimate of dose, from a credible source, submitted by or on behalf of a claimant, and dose data derived from official military records, the estimates and supporting documentation shall be referred to an independent expert, selected by the Director of the National Institutes of Health, who shall prepare a separate radiation dose estimate for consideration in adjudication of the claim. For purposes of this paragraph:
</P>
<P>(i) The difference between the claimant's estimate and dose data derived from official military records shall ordinarily be considered material if one estimate is at least double the other estimate.
</P>
<P>(ii) A dose estimate shall be considered from a &#x201C;credible source&#x201D; if prepared by a person or persons certified by an appropriate professional body in the field of health physics, nuclear medicine or radiology and if based on analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular claim.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Exposure.</I> In cases described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) If military records do not establish presence at or absence from a site at which exposure to radiation is claimed to have occurred, the veteran's presence at the site will be conceded.
</P>
<P>(ii) Neither the veteran nor the veteran's survivors may be required to produce evidence substantiating exposure if the information in the veteran's service records or other records maintained by the Department of Defense is consistent with the claim that the veteran was present where and when the claimed exposure occurred.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Initial review of claims.</I> (1) When it is determined:
</P>
<P>(i) A veteran was exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of participation in the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, from September 1945 until July 1946, or other activities as claimed;
</P>
<P>(ii) The veteran subsequently developed a radiogenic disease; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Such disease first became manifest within the period specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; before its adjudication the claim will be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits for further consideration in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If any of the foregoing 3 requirements has not been met, it shall not be determined that a disease has resulted from exposure to ionizing radiation under such circumstances.
</P>
<P>(2) For purposes of this section the term &#x201C;radiogenic disease&#x201D; means a disease that may be induced by ionizing radiation and shall include the following:

Even so, VA will consider a claim based on the assertion that polycythemia vera is a radiogenic disease under the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: Pub. L. 98&#x2013;542, section 5(b)(2)(A)(i), (iii)).
</PARAUTH>
<P>(4) If a claim is based on a disease other than one of those listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, VA shall nevertheless consider the claim under the provisions of this section provided that the claimant has cited or submitted competent scientific or medical evidence that the claimed condition is a radiogenic disease.
</P>
<P>(5) For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) Bone cancer must become manifest within 30 years after exposure;
</P>
<P>(ii) Leukemia may become manifest at any time after exposure;
</P>
<P>(iii) Posterior subcapsular cataracts must become manifest 6 months or more after exposure; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Other diseases specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must become manifest 5 years or more after exposure.

<P>(c) <I>Review by Under Secretary for Benefits.</I> (1) When a claim is forwarded for review pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall consider the claim with reference to the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section and may request an advisory medical opinion from the Under Secretary for Health.
</P>
<P>(i) If after such consideration the Under Secretary for Benefits is convinced sound scientific and medical evidence supports the conclusion it is at least as likely as not the veteran's disease resulted from exposure to radiation in service, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall so inform the regional office of jurisdiction in writing. The Under Secretary for Benefits shall set forth the rationale for this conclusion, including an evaluation of the claim under the applicable factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) If the Under Secretary for Benefits determines there is no reasonable possibility that the veteran's disease resulted from radiation exposure in service, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall so inform the regional office of jurisidiction in writing, setting forth the rationale for this conclusion.
</P>
<P>(2) If the Under Secretary for Benefits, after considering any opinion of the Under Secretary for Health, is unable to conclude whether it is at least as likely as not, or that there is no reasonable possibility, the veteran's disease resulted from radiation exposure in service, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall refer the matter to an outside consultant in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, &#x201C;sound scientific evidence&#x201D; means observations, findings, or conclusions which are statistically and epidemiologically valid, are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review, and &#x201C;sound medical evidence&#x201D; means observations, findings, or conclusions which are consistent with current medical knowledge and are so reasonable and logical as to serve as the basis of management of a medical condition.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Referral to outside consultants.</I> (1) Referrals pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall be to consultants selected by the Under Secretary for Health from outside VA, upon the recommendation of the Director of the National Cancer Institute. The consultant will be asked to evaluate the claim and provide an opinion as to the likelihood the disease is a result of exposure as claimed.
</P>
<P>(2) The request for opinion shall be in writing and shall include a description of:
</P>
<P>(i) The disease, including the specific cell type and stage, if known, and when the disease first became manifest;
</P>
<P>(ii) The circumstances, including date, of the veteran's exposure;
</P>
<P>(iii) The veteran's age, gender, and pertinent family history;
</P>
<P>(iv) The veteran's history of exposure to known carcinogens, occupationally or otherwise;
</P>
<P>(v) Evidence of any other effects radiation exposure may have had on the veteran; and
</P>
<P>(vi) Any other information relevant to determination of causation of the veteran's disease.
</P>
<FP>The Under Secretary for Benefits shall forward, with the request, copies of pertinent medical records and, where available, dose assessments from official sources, from credible sources as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, and from an independent expert pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
</FP>
<P>(3) The consultant shall evaluate the claim under the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section and respond in writing, stating whether it is either likely, unlikely, or approximately as likely as not the veteran's disease resulted from exposure to ionizing radiation in service. The response shall set forth the rationale for the consultant's conclusion, including the consultant's evaluation under the applicable factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The Under Secretary for Benefits shall review the consultant's response and transmit it with any comments to the regional office of jurisdiction for use in adjudication of the claim.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Factors for consideration.</I> Factors to be considered in determining whether a veteran's disease resulted from exposure to ionizing radiation in service include:
</P>
<P>(1) The probable dose, in terms of dose type, rate and duration as a factor in inducing the disease, taking into account any known limitations in the dosimetry devices employed in its measurement or the methodologies employed in its estimation;
</P>
<P>(2) The relative sensitivity of the involved tissue to induction, by ionizing radiation, of the specific pathology;
</P>
<P>(3) The veteran's gender and pertinent family history;
</P>
<P>(4) The veteran's age at time of exposure;
</P>
<P>(5) The time-lapse between exposure and onset of the disease; and
</P>
<P>(6) The extent to which exposure to radiation, or other carcinogens, outside of service may have contributed to development of the disease.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Adjudication of claim.</I> The determination of service connection will be made under the generally applicable provisions of this part, giving due consideration to all evidence of record, including any opinion provided by the Under Secretary for Health or an outside consultant, and to the evaluations published pursuant to &#xA7; 1.17 of this title. With regard to any issue material to consideration of a claim, the provisions of &#xA7; 3.102 of this title apply.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Willful misconduct and supervening cause.</I> In no case will service connection be established if the disease is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct, or if there is affirmative evidence to establish that a supervening, nonservice-related condition or event is more likely the cause of the disease.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.312 Cause of death.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The death of a veteran will be considered as having been due to a service-connected disability when the evidence establishes that such disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of death. The issue involved will be determined by exercise of sound judgment, without recourse to speculation, after a careful analysis has been made of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of the veteran, including, particularly, autopsy reports.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Principal cause of death.</I> The service-connected disability will be considered as the principal (primary) cause of death when such disability, singly or jointly with some other condition, was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related thereto.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Contributory cause of death.</I> (1) Contributory cause of death is inherently one not related to the principal cause. In determining whether the service-connected disability contributed to death, it must be shown that it contributed substantially or materially; that it combined to cause death; that it aided or lent assistance to the production of death. It is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection.
</P>
<P>(2) Generally, minor service-connected disabilities, particularly those of a static nature or not materially affecting a vital organ, would not be held to have contributed to death primarily due to unrelated disability. In the same category there would be included service-connected disease or injuries of any evaluation (even though evaluated as 100 percent disabling) but of a quiescent or static nature involving muscular or skeletal functions and not materially affecting other vital body functions.
</P>
<P>(3) Service-connected diseases or injuries involving active processes affecting vital organs should receive careful consideration as a contributory cause of death, the primary cause being unrelated, from the viewpoint of whether there were resulting debilitating effects and general impairment of health to an extent that would render the person materially less capable of resisting the effects of other disease or injury primarily causing death. Where the service-connected condition affects vital organs as distinguished from muscular or skeletal functions and is evaluated as 100 percent disabling, debilitation may be assumed.
</P>
<P>(4) There are primary causes of death which by their very nature are so overwhelming that eventual death can be anticipated irrespective of coexisting conditions, but, even in such cases, there is for consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a service-connected condition was of such severity as to have a material influence in accelerating death. In this situation, however, it would not generally be reasonable to hold that a service-connected condition accelerated death unless such condition affected a vital organ and was of itself of a progressive or debilitating nature.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.314 Basic pension determinations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Prior to the Mexican border period.</I> While pensions are granted based on certain service prior to the Mexican border period, the only rating factors in claims therefor are:
</P>
<P>(1) Claims based on service of less than 90 days in the Spanish-American War require a rating determination as to whether the veteran was discharged or released from service for a service-connected disability or had at the time of separation from service a service-connected disability, shown by official service records, which in medical judgment would have warranted a discharge for disability. Eligibility in such cases requires a finding that the disability was incurred in or aggravated by service in line of duty without benefit of presumptive provisions of law or Department of Veterans Affairs regulations.

<P>(2) Veterans entitled to pension on the basis of service in the Spanish-American War may be entitled to an increased rate of pension if rated as being in need of regular aid and attendance. Veterans who have elected pension under Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211 (73 Stat. 432) who are not rated as being in need of regular aid and attendance may be entitled to increased pension based on 100 percent permanent disability together with independent disability of 60 percent or more or by reason of being permanently housebound as provided in &#xA7; 3.351 (d).

<P>(b) <I>Mexican border period and later war periods.</I> Non-service-connected disability and death pension may be paid based on service in the Mexican border period, World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict and the Vietnam era. Rating determinations in such claims will be required in the following situations:
</P>
<P>(1) Claims based on service of less than 90 days may require a determination as to whether the veteran was discharged or released from service for a service-connected disability or had at the time of separation from service a service-connected disability, shown by official service records, which in medical judgment would have warranted a discharge for disability. Eligibility in such cases requires a finding that the disability was incurred in or aggravated by service in line of duty without benefit of presumptive provisions of law or Department of Veterans Affairs regulations (38 U.S.C. 1521(g)(2)) unless, in the case of death pension, the veteran was, at the time of death, receiving (or entitled to receive) compensation or retirement pay based upon a wartime service-connected disability.

However, for pension under Pub. L. 86&#x2013;211 (73 Stat. 432), permanent and total disability will be presumed where the veteran has attained age 65 or effective January 1, 1977, where the veteran became unemployable after age 65.

<P>Functional gastrointestinal disorders are a group of conditions characterized by chronic or recurrent symptoms that are unexplained by any structural, endoscopic, laboratory, or other objective signs of injury or disease and may be related to any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Specific functional gastrointestinal disorders include, but are not limited to, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, functional vomiting, functional constipation, functional bloating, functional abdominal pain syndrome, and functional dysphagia. These disorders are commonly characterized by symptoms including abdominal pain, substernal burning or pain, nausea, vomiting, altered bowel habits (including diarrhea, constipation), indigestion, bloating, postprandial fullness, and painful or difficult swallowing. Diagnosis of specific functional gastrointestinal disorders is made in accordance with established medical principles, which generally require symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis and the presence of symptoms sufficient to diagnose the specific disorder at least 3 months prior to diagnosis.</P></NOTE>
<P>(ii) For purposes of this section, the term <I>medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness</I> means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, will not be considered medically unexplained.
</P>
<P>(3) For purposes of this section, &#x201C;objective indications of chronic disability&#x201D; include both &#x201C;signs,&#x201D; in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification.
</P>
<P>(4) For purposes of this section, disabilities that have existed for 6 months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a 6-month period will be considered chronic. The 6-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.

<P>(c) <I>Presumptive service connection for infectious diseases.</I> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a disease listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be service connected if it becomes manifest in a veteran with a qualifying period of service, provided the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section are also satisfied.
</P>
<P>(2) The diseases referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Brucellosis.
</P>
<P>(ii) Campylobacter jejuni.
</P>
<P>(iii) Coxiella burnetii (Q fever).
</P>
<P>(iv) Malaria.

</P>
<P>(vii) Shigella.
</P>
<P>(viii) Visceral leishmaniasis.
</P>
<P>(ix) West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>(3) The diseases listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by service under the circumstances outlined in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.
</P>
<P>(i) With three exceptions, the disease must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year from the date of separation from a qualifying period of service as specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Malaria must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year from the date of separation from a qualifying period of service or at a time when standard or accepted treatises indicate that the incubation period commenced during a qualifying period of service. There is no time limit for visceral leishmaniasis or tuberculosis to have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term <I>qualifying period of service</I> means a period of service meeting the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section or a period of active military, naval, or air service on or after September 19, 2001, in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>(4) A disease listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not be presumed service connected:
</P>
<P>(i) If there is affirmative evidence that the disease was not incurred during a qualifying period of service; or
</P>
<P>(ii) If there is affirmative evidence that the disease was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the veteran's most recent departure from a qualifying period of service and the onset of the disease; or
</P>
<P>(iii) If there is affirmative evidence that the disease is the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Long-term health effects potentially associated with infectious diseases.</I> (1) A report of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences has identified the following long-term health effects that potentially are associated with the infectious diseases listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. These health effects and diseases are listed alphabetically and are not categorized by the level of association stated in the National Academy of Sciences report (<I>see</I> Table to &#xA7; 3.317). If a veteran who has or had an infectious disease identified in column A also has a condition identified in column B as potentially related to that infectious disease, VA must determine, based on the evidence in each case, whether the column B condition was caused by the infectious disease for purposes of paying disability compensation. This does not preclude a finding that other manifestations of disability or secondary conditions were caused by an infectious disease.
</P>
<P>(2) If a veteran presumed service connected for one of the diseases listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is diagnosed with one of the diseases listed in column &#x201C;B&#x201D; in the table within the time period specified for the disease in the same table, if a time period is specified or, otherwise, at any time, VA will request a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the condition was caused by the veteran having had the associated disease in column &#x201C;A&#x201D; in that same table.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.321 General rating considerations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Use of rating schedule.</I> The 1945 Schedule for Rating Disabilities will be used for evaluating the degree of disabilities in claims for disability compensation, disability and death pension, and in eligibility determinations. The provisions contained in the rating schedule will represent as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity in civil occupations resulting from disability.
</P>

</PARAUTH>
<P>(b)<I> Extra-schedular ratings in unusual cases</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Disability compensation.</I> Ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity with the additional proviso that the Secretary shall from time to time readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience. To accord justice to the exceptional case where the schedular evaluation is inadequate to rate a single service-connected disability, the Director of Compensation Service or his or her delegate is authorized to approve on the basis of the criteria set forth in this paragraph (b), an extra-schedular evaluation commensurate with the average impairment of earning capacity due exclusively to the disability. The governing norm in these exceptional cases is a finding by the Director of Compensation Service or delegatee that application of the regular schedular standards is impractical because the disability is so exceptional or unusual due to such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Pension.</I> Where the evidence of record establishes that an applicant for pension who is basically eligible fails to meet the disability requirements based on the percentage standards of the rating schedule but is found to be unemployable by reason of his or her disability(ies), age, occupational background and other related factors, the following are authorized to approve on an extra-schedular basis a permanent and total disability rating for pension purposes: the Veterans Service Center Manager or the Pension Management Center Manager; or where regular schedular standards are met as of the date of the rating decision, the rating board.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Effective dates.</I> The effective date of these extra-schedular evaluations granting or increasing benefits will be in accordance with &#xA7; 3.400(b)(1) and (2) as to original and supplemental claims and in accordance with &#xA7; 3.400(o) in claims for increased benefits.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.322 Rating of disabilities aggravated by service.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Aggravation of preservice disability.</I> In cases involving aggravation by active service, the rating will reflect only the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing at the time of entrance into active service, whether the particular condition was noted at the time of entrance into active service, or whether it is determined upon the evidence of record to have existed at that time. It is necessary to deduct from the present evaluation the degree, if ascertainable, of the disability existing at the time of entrance into active service, in terms of the rating schedule except that if the disability is total (100 percent) no deduction will be made. If the degree of disability at the time of entrance into service is not ascertainable in terms of the schedule, no deduction will be made.

<P>(b) <I>Aggravation of service-connected disability.</I> Where a disease or injury incurred in peacetime service is aggravated during service in a period of war, or conversely, where a disease or injury incurred in service during a period of war is aggravated during peacetime service, the entire disability flowing from the disease or injury will be service connected based on the war service.

<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Reexaminations, including periods of hospital observation, will be requested whenever VA determines there is a need to verify either the continued existence or the current severity of a disability. Generally, reexaminations will be required if it is likely that a disability has improved, or if evidence indicates there has been a material change in a disability or that the current rating may be incorrect. Individuals for whom reexaminations have been authorized and scheduled are required to report for such reexaminations. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provide general guidelines for requesting reexaminations, but shall not be construed as limiting VA's authority to request reexaminations, or periods of hospital observation, at any time in order to ensure that a disability is accurately rated.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.340 Total and permanent total ratings and unemployability.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Total disability ratings</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. Total disability may or may not be permanent. Total ratings will not be assigned, generally, for temporary exacerbations or acute infectious diseases except where specifically prescribed by the schedule.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Schedule for rating disabilities.</I> Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for Rating Disabilities prescribes a 100 percent evaluation or, with less disability, where the requirements of paragraph 16, page 5 of the rating schedule are present or where, in pension cases, the requirements of paragraph 17, page 5 of the schedule are met.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Ratings of total disability on history.</I> In the case of disabilities which have undergone some recent improvement, a rating of total disability may be made, provided:
</P>
<P>(i) That the disability must in the past have been of sufficient severity to warrant a total disability rating;
</P>
<P>(ii) That it must have required extended, continuous, or intermittent hospitalization, or have produced total industrial incapacity for at least 1 year, or be subject to recurring, severe, frequent, or prolonged exacerbations; and
</P>
<P>(iii) That it must be the opinion of the rating agency that despite the recent improvement of the physical condition, the veteran will be unable to effect an adjustment into a substantially gainful occupation. Due consideration will be given to the frequency and duration of totally incapacitating exacerbations since incurrence of the original disease or injury, and to periods of hospitalization for treatment in determining whether the average person could have reestablished himself or herself in a substantially gainful occupation.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Permanent total disability.</I> Permanence of total disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. The permanent loss or loss of use of both hands, or of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or of the sight of both eyes, or becoming permanently helpless or bedridden constitutes permanent total disability. Diseases and injuries of long standing which are actually totally incapacitating will be regarded as permanently and totally disabling when the probability of permanent improvement under treatment is remote. Permanent total disability ratings may not be granted as a result of any incapacity from acute infectious disease, accident, or injury, unless there is present one of the recognized combinations or permanent loss of use of extremities or sight, or the person is in the strict sense permanently helpless or bedridden, or when it is reasonably certain that a subsidence of the acute or temporary symptoms will be followed by irreducible totality of disability by way of residuals. The age of the disabled person may be considered in determining permanence.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Insurance ratings.</I> A rating of permanent and total disability for insurance purposes will have no effect on ratings for compensation or pension.

</PARAUTH>
<P>(b) <I>Criteria.</I> In addition to the criteria for determining total disability and permanency of total disability contained in &#xA7; 3.340, the following special considerations apply in pension cases:
</P>
<P>(1) Permanent total disability pension ratings will be authorized for congenital, developmental, hereditary or familial conditions, provided the other requirements for entitlement are met.
</P>
<P>(2) The permanence of total disability will be established as of the earliest date consistent with the evidence in the case. Active pulmonary tuberculosis not otherwise established as permanently and totally disabling will be presumed so after 6 months' hospitalization without improvement. The same principle may be applied with other types of disabilities requiring hospitalization for indefinite periods. The need for hospitalization for periods shorter or longer than 6 months may be a proper basis for determining permanence. Where, in application of this principle, it is necessary to employ a waiting period to determine permanence of totality of disability and a report received at the end of such period shows the veteran's condition is unimproved, permanence may be established as of the date of entrance into the hospital. Similarly, when active pulmonary tuberculosis is improved after 6 months' hospitalization but still diagnosed as active after 12 months' hospitalization permanence will also be established as of the date of entrance into the hospital. In other cases the rating will be effective the date the evidence establishes permanence.
</P>
<P>(3) Special consideration must be given the question of permanence in the case of veterans under 40 years of age. For such veterans, permanence of total disability requires a finding that the end result of treatment and adjustment to residual handicaps (rehabilitation) will be permanent disability of the required degree precluding more than marginal employment. Severe diseases and injuries, including multiple fractures or the amputation of a single extremity, should not be taken to establish permanent and total disability until it is shown that the veteran after treatment and convalescence, has been unable to secure or follow employment because of the disability and through no fault of the veteran.
</P>
<P>(4) The following shall not be considered as evidence of employability:
</P>
<P>(i) Employment as a member-employer or similar employment obtained only in competition with disabled persons.
</P>
<P>(ii) Participation in, or the receipt of a distribution of funds as a result of participation in, a therapeutic or rehabilitation activity under 38 U.S.C. 1718.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1718(f))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(5) The authority granted the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. 1502(a)(2) to classify as permanent and total those diseases and disorders, the nature and extent of which, in the Secretary judgment, will justify such determination, will be exercised under &#xA7; 3.321(b).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Temporary program of vocational rehabilitation training for certain pension recipients.</I> (1) When a veteran under age 45 is awarded disability pension during the period beginning on February 1, 1985, and ending on December 31, 1995, the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&amp;E) Division will be notified so that an evaluation may be made, as provided in &#xA7; 21.6050, to determine that veteran's potential for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>(2) If a veteran secures employment within the scope of a vocational goal identified in his or her individualized written vocational rehabilitation plan, or in a related field which requires reasonably developed skills and the use of some or all of the training or services furnished the veteran under such plan, not later than one year after eligibility to counseling under &#xA7; 21.6040(b)(1) of this chapter expires, the veteran's permanent and total evaluation for pension purposes shall not be terminated by reason of the veteran's capacity to engage in such employment until the veteran has maintained that employment for a period of not less than 12 consecutive months.

Examination reports showing material improvement must be evaluated in conjunction with all the facts of record, and consideration must be given particularly to whether the veteran attained improvement under the ordinary conditions of life, <I>i.e.</I>, while working or actively seeking work or whether the symptoms have been brought under control by prolonged rest, or generally, by following a regimen which precludes work, and, if the latter, reduction from total disability ratings will not be considered pending reexamination after a period of employment (3 to 6 months).

<P>(b) <I>Tuberculosis; compensation.</I> In service-connected cases, evaluations for active or inactive tuberculosis will be governed by the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (part 4 of this chapter). Where in the opinion of the rating board the veteran at the expiration of the period during which a total rating is provided will not be able to maintain inactivity of the disease process under the ordinary conditions of life, the case will be submitted under &#xA7; 3.321.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Individual unemployability.</I> (1) In reducing a rating of 100 percent service-connected disability based on individual unemployability, the provisions of &#xA7; 3.105(e) are for application but caution must be exercised in such a determination that actual employability is established by clear and convincing evidence. When in such a case the veteran is undergoing vocational rehabilitation, education or training, the rating will not be reduced by reason thereof unless there is received evidence of marked improvement or recovery in physical or mental conditions or of employment progress, income earned, and prospects of economic rehabilitation, which demonstrates affirmatively the veteran's capacity to pursue the vocation or occupation for which the training is intended to qualify him or her, or unless the physical or mental demands of the course are obviously incompatible with total disability. Neither participation in, nor the receipt of remuneration as a result of participation in, a therapeutic or rehabilitation activity under 38 U.S.C. 1718 shall be considered evidence of employability.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.344 Stabilization of disability evaluations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Examination reports indicating improvement.</I> Rating agencies will handle cases affected by change of medical findings or diagnosis, so as to produce the greatest degree of stability of disability evaluations consistent with the laws and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations governing disability compensation and pension. It is essential that the entire record of examinations and the medical-industrial history be reviewed to ascertain whether the recent examination is full and complete, including all special examinations indicated as a result of general examination and the entire case history. This applies to treatment of intercurrent diseases and exacerbations, including hospital reports, bedside examinations, examinations by designated physicians, and examinations in the absence of, or without taking full advantage of, laboratory facilities and the cooperation of specialists in related lines. Examinations less full and complete than those on which payments were authorized or continued will not be used as a basis of reduction. Ratings on account of diseases subject to temporary or episodic improvement, e.g., manic depressive or other psychotic reaction, epilepsy, psychoneurotic reaction, arteriosclerotic heart disease, bronchial asthma, gastric or duodenal ulcer, many skin diseases, etc., will not be reduced on any one examination, except in those instances where all the evidence of record clearly warrants the conclusion that sustained improvement has been demonstrated. Ratings on account of diseases which become comparatively symptom free (findings absent) after prolonged rest, e.g. residuals of phlebitis, arteriosclerotic heart disease, etc., will not be reduced on examinations reflecting the results of bed rest. Moreover, though material improvement in the physical or mental condition is clearly reflected the rating agency will consider whether the evidence makes it reasonably certain that the improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life. When syphilis of the central nervous system or alcoholic deterioration is diagnosed following a long prior history of psychosis, psychoneurosis, epilepsy, or the like, it is rarely possible to exclude persistence, in masked form, of the preceding innocently acquired manifestations. Rating boards encountering a change of diagnosis will exercise caution in the determination as to whether a change in diagnosis represents no more than a progression of an earlier diagnosis, an error in prior diagnosis or possibly a disease entity independent of the service-connected disability. When the new diagnosis reflects mental deficiency or personality disorder only, the possibility of only temporary remission of a super-imposed psychiatric disease will be borne in mind.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Doubtful cases.</I> If doubt remains, after according due consideration to all the evidence developed by the several items discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, the rating agency will continue the rating in effect, citing the former diagnosis with the new diagnosis in parentheses, and following the appropriate code there will be added the reference &#x201C;Rating continued pending reexamination ______ months from this date, &#xA7; 3.344.&#x201D; The rating agency will determine on the basis of the facts in each individual case whether 18, 24 or 30 months will be allowed to elapse before the reexamination will be made.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Disabilities which are likely to improve.</I> The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to ratings which have continued for long periods at the same level (5 years or more). They do not apply to disabilities which have not become stabilized and are likely to improve. Reexaminations disclosing improvement, physical or mental, in these disabilities will warrant reduction in rating.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.350 Special monthly compensation ratings.</HEAD>
<P>The rates of special monthly compensation stated in this section are those provided under 38 U.S.C. 1114.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k).</I> Special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) is payable for each anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand, one foot, both buttocks, one or more creative organs, blindness of one eye having only light perception, deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone conduction, complete organic aphonia with constant inability to communicate by speech or, in the case of a woman veteran, loss of 25% or more of tissue from a single breast or both breasts in combination (including loss by mastectomy or partial mastectomy), or following receipt of radiation treatment of breast tissue. This special compensation is payable in addition to the basic rate of compensation otherwise payable on the basis of degree of disability, provided that the combined rate of compensation does not exceed the monthly rate set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) when authorized in conjunction with any of the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1114 (a) through (j) or (s). When there is entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through (n) or an intermediate rate under (p) such additional allowance is payable for each such anatomical loss or loss of use existing in addition to the requirements for the basic rates, provided the total does not exceed the monthly rate set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1114(o). The limitations on the maximum compensation payable under this paragraph are independent of and do not preclude payment of additional compensation for dependents under 38 U.S.C. 1115, or the special allowance for aid and attendance provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(r).
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Creative organ.</I> (i) Loss of a creative organ will be shown by acquired absence of one or both testicles (other than undescended testicles) or ovaries or other creative organ. Loss of use of one testicle will be established when examination by a board finds that:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) The diameters of the affected testicle are reduced to one-third of the corresponding diameters of the paired normal testicle, or
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) The diameters of the affected testicle are reduced to one-half or less of the corresponding normal testicle and there is alteration of consistency so that the affected testicle is considerably harder or softer than the corresponding normal testicle; or
</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) If neither of the conditions (<I>a</I>) or (<I>b</I>) is met, when a biopsy, recommended by a board including a genitourologist and accepted by the veteran, establishes the absence of spermatozoa.
</P>
<P>(ii) When loss or loss of use of a creative organ resulted from wounds or other trauma sustained in service, or resulted from operations in service for the relief of other conditions, the creative organ becoming incidentally involved, the benefit may be granted.
</P>
<P>(iii) Loss or loss of use traceable to an elective operation performed subsequent to service, will not establish entitlement to the benefit. If, however, the operation after discharge was required for the correction of a specific injury caused by a preceding operation in service, it will support authorization of the benefit. When the existence of disability is established meeting the above requirements for nonfunctioning testicle due to operation after service, resulting in loss of use, the benefit may be granted even though the operation is one of election. An operation is not considered to be one of election where it is advised on sound medical judgment for the relief of a pathological condition or to prevent possible future pathological consequences.
</P>
<P>(iv) Atrophy resulting from mumps followed by orchitis in service is service connected. Since atrophy is usually perceptible within 1 to 6 months after infection subsides, an examination more than 6 months after the subsidence of orchitis demonstrating a normal genitourinary system will be considered in determining rebuttal of service incurrence of atrophy later demonstrated. Mumps not followed by orchitis in service will not suffice as the antecedent cause of subsequent atrophy for the purpose of authorizing the benefit.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Foot and hand.</I> (i) Loss of use of a hand or a foot will be held to exist when no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump at the site of election below elbow or knee with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance. The determination will be made on the basis of the actual remaining function, whether the acts of grasping, manipulation, etc., in the case of the hand, or of balance, propulsion, etc., in the case of the foot, could be accomplished equally well by an amputation stump with prosthesis; for example:
</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) Extremely unfavorable complete ankylosis of the knee, or complete ankylosis of two major joints of an extremity, or shortening of the lower extremity of 3
<FR>1/2</FR> inches or more, will constitute loss of use of the hand or foot involved.
</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) Complete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve (common peroneal) and consequent footdrop, accompanied by characteristic organic changes including trophic and circulatory disturbances and other concomitants confirmatory of complete paralysis of this nerve, will be taken as loss of use of the foot.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Both buttocks.</I> (i) Loss of use of both buttocks shall be deemed to exist when there is severe damage by disease or injury to muscle group XVII, bilateral, (diagnostic code 5317) and additional disability making it impossible for the disabled person, without assistance, to rise from a seated position and from a stooped position (fingers to toes position) and to maintain postural stability (the pelvis upon head of femur). The assistance may be done by the person's own hands or arms, and, in the matter of postural stability, by a special appliance.
</P>

</PARAUTH>
<P>(ii) Special monthly compensation for loss or loss of use of both lower extremities (38 U.S.C. 1114(l) through (n)) will not preclude additional compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) for loss of use of both buttocks where appropriate tests clearly substantiate that there is such additional loss.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Eye.</I> Loss of use or blindness of one eye, having only light perception, will be held to exist when there is inability to recognize test letters at 1 foot and when further examination of the eye reveals that perception of objects, hand movements, or counting fingers cannot be accomplished at 3 feet. Lesser extents of vision, particularly perception of objects, hand movements, or counting fingers at distances less than 3 feet is considered of negligible utility.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Deafness.</I> Deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone conduction will be held to exist where examination in a Department of Veterans Affairs authorized audiology clinic under current testing criteria shows bilateral hearing loss is equal to or greater than the minimum bilateral hearing loss required for a maximum rating evaluation under the rating schedule.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: Pub. L. 88&#x2013;20)

<P>(6) <I>Aphonia.</I> Complete organic aphonia will be held to exist where there is a disability of the organs of speech which constantly precludes communication by speech.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: Pub. L. 88&#x2013;22)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(b) <I>Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l).</I> The special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) is payable for anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, one hand and one foot, blindness in both eyes with visual acuity of 5/200 or less or being permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Extremities.</I> The criteria for loss and loss of use of an extremity contained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are applicable.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Eyes, bilateral.</I> 5/200 visual acuity or less bilaterally qualifies for entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l). However, evaluation of 5/200 based on acuity in excess of that degree but less than 10/200 (&#xA7; 4.83 of this chapter), does not qualify. Concentric contraction of the field of vision beyond 5 degrees in both eyes is the equivalent of 5/200 visual acuity.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Need for aid and attendance.</I> The criteria for determining that a veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance are contained in &#xA7; 3.352(a).
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Permanently bedridden.</I> The criteria for rating are contained in &#xA7; 3.352(a). Where possible, determinations should be on the basis of permanently bedridden rather than for need of aid and attendance (except where 38 U.S.C. 1114(r) is involved) to avoid reduction during hospitalization where aid and attendance is provided in kind.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m).</I> (1) The special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) is payable for any of the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(i) Anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands;
</P>
<P>(ii) Anatomical loss or loss of use of both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place;
</P>
<P>(iii) Anatomical loss or loss of use of one arm at a level, or with complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place with anatomical loss or loss of use of one leg at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place;
</P>
<P>(iv) Blindness in both eyes having only light perception;
</P>
<P>(v) Blindness in both eyes leaving the veteran so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Natural elbow or knee action.</I> In determining whether there is natural elbow or knee action with prosthesis in place, consideration will be based on whether use of the proper prosthetic appliance requires natural use of the joint, or whether necessary motion is otherwise controlled, so that the muscles affecting joint motion, if not already atrophied, will become so. If there is no movement in the joint, as in ankylosis or complete paralysis, use of prosthesis is not to be expected, and the determination will be as though there were one in place.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Eyes, bilateral.</I> With visual acuity 5/200 or less or the vision field reduced to 5 degree concentric contraction in both eyes, entitlement on account of need for regular aid and attendance will be determined on the facts in the individual case.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(n).</I> The special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(n) is payable for any of the conditions which follow: Amputation is a prerequisite except for loss of use of both arms and blindness without light perception in both eyes. If a prosthesis cannot be worn at the present level of amputation but could be applied if there were a reamputation at a higher level, the requirements of this paragraph are not met; instead, consideration will be given to loss of natural elbow or knee action.
</P>
<P>(1) Anatomical loss or loss of use of both arms at a level or with complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place;
</P>
<P>(2) Anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance;
</P>
<P>(3) Anatomical loss of one arm so near the shoulder as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance with anatomical loss of one leg so near the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance;
</P>
<P>(4) Anatomical loss of both eyes or blindness without light perception in both eyes.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (o).</I> (1) The special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) is payable for any of the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(i) Anatomical loss of both arms so near the shoulder as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance;
</P>
<P>(ii) Conditions entitling to two or more of the rates (no condition being considered twice) provided in 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) through (n);
</P>
<P>(iii) Bilateral deafness rated at 60 percent or more disabling (and the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service connected) in combination with service-connected blindness with bilateral visual acuity 20/200 or less.
</P>
<P>(iv) Service-connected total deafness in one ear or bilateral deafness rated at 40 percent or more disabling (and the hearing impairment in either one of both ears is service-connected) in combination with service-connected blindness of both eyes having only light perception or less.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Paraplegia.</I> Paralysis of both lower extremities together with loss of anal and bladder sphincter control will entitle to the maximum rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o), through the combination of loss of use of both legs and helplessness. The requirement of loss of anal and bladder sphincter control is met even though incontinence has been overcome under a strict regimen of rehabilitation of bowel and bladder training and other auxiliary measures.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Combinations.</I> Determinations must be based upon separate and distinct disabilities. This requires, for example, that where a veteran who had suffered the loss or loss of use of two extremities is being considered for the maximum rate on account of helplessness requiring regular aid and attendance, the latter must be based on need resulting from pathology other than that of the extremities. If the loss or loss of use of two extremities or being permanently bedridden leaves the person helpless, increase is not in order on account of this helplessness. Under no circumstances will the combination of &#x201C;being permanently bedridden&#x201D; and &#x201C;being so helpless as to require regular aid and attendance&#x201D; without separate and distinct anatomical loss, or loss of use, of two extremities, or blindness, be taken as entitling to the maximum benefit. The fact, however, that two separate and distinct entitling disabilities, such as anatomical loss, or loss of use of both hands and both feet, result from a common etiological agent, for example, one injury or rheumatoid arthritis, will not preclude maximum entitlement.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Helplessness.</I> The maximum rate, as a result of including helplessness as one of the entitling multiple disabilities, is intended to cover, in addition to obvious losses and blindness, conditions such as the loss of use of two extremities with absolute deafness and nearly total blindness or with severe multiple injuries producing total disability outside the useless extremities, these conditions being construed as loss of use of two extremities and helplessness.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Intermediate or next higher rate.</I> An intermediate rate authorized by this paragraph shall be established at the arithmetic mean, rounded to the nearest dollar, between the two rates concerned.

Determination of this need is subject to the criteria of &#xA7; 3.352.
</P>
<P>(1) A veteran described in this paragraph (j) shall be entitled to the amount equal to the compensation authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) or the maximum rate authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(p) and, in addition to such compensation, a monthly allowance equal to the rate described in 38 U.S.C. 1114(r)(2) during periods he or she is not hospitalized at United States Government expense.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.352 Criteria for determining need for aid and attendance and &#x201C;permanently bedridden.&#x201D;</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Basic criteria for regular aid and attendance and permanently bedridden.</I> The following will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance (&#xA7; 3.351(c)(3): inability of claimant to dress or undress himself (herself), or to keep himself (herself) ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of claimant to feed himself (herself) through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment. &#x201C;Bedridden&#x201D; will be a proper basis for the determination. For the purpose of this paragraph &#x201C;bedridden&#x201D; will be that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that the veteran is so helpless, as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Basic criteria for the higher level aid and attendance allowance.</I> (1) A veteran is entitled to the higher level aid and attendance allowance authorized by &#xA7; 3.350(h) in lieu of the regular aid and attendance allowance when all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(i) The veteran is entitled to the compensation authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o), or the maximum rate of compensation authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(p).
</P>
<P>(ii) The veteran meets the requirements for entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The veteran needs a &#x201C;higher level of care&#x201D; (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) than is required to establish entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance, and in the absence of the provision of such higher level of care the veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care.
</P>
<P>(2) A veteran is entitled to the higher level aid and attendance allowance authorized by &#xA7; 3.350(j) in lieu of the regular aid and attendance allowance when all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(i) As a result of service-connected residuals of traumatic brain injury, the veteran meets the requirements for entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) As a result of service-connected residuals of traumatic brain injury, the veteran needs a &#x201C;higher level of care&#x201D; (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) than is required to establish entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance, and in the absence of the provision of such higher level of care the veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care.
</P>
<P>(3) Need for a higher level of care shall be considered to be need for personal health-care services provided on a daily basis in the veteran's home by a person who is licensed to provide such services or who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional. Personal health-care services include (but are not limited to) such services as physical therapy, administration of injections, placement of indwelling catheters, and the changing of sterile dressings, or like functions which require professional health-care training or the regular supervision of a trained health-care professional to perform. A licensed health-care professional includes (but is not limited to) a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse, or a physical therapist licensed to practice by a State or political subdivision thereof.
</P>
<P>(4) The term &#x201C;under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional&#x201D;, as used in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, means that an unlicensed person performing personal health-care services is following a regimen of personal health-care services prescribed by a health-care professional, and that the health-care professional consults with the unlicensed person providing the health-care services at least once each month to monitor the prescribed regimen. The consultation need not be in person; a telephone call will suffice.
</P>
<P>(5) A person performing personal health-care services who is a relative or other member of the veteran's household is not exempted from the requirement that he or she be a licensed health-care professional or be providing such care under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional.
</P>
<P>(6) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are to be strictly construed. The higher level aid-and-attendance allowance is to be granted only when the veteran's need is clearly established and the amount of services required by the veteran on a daily basis is substantial.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Attendance by relative.</I> The performance of the necessary aid and attendance service by a relative of the beneficiary or other member of his or her household will not prevent the granting of the additional allowance.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.353 Determinations of incompetency and competency.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definition of mental incompetency.</I> A mentally incompetent person is one who because of injury or disease lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, including disbursement of funds without limitation.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Authority.</I> (1) Rating agencies have sole authority to make official determinations of competency and incompetency for purposes of: insurance (38 U.S.C. 1922), and, subject to &#xA7; 13.110 of this chapter, disbursement of benefits. Such determinations are final and binding on field stations for these purposes.
</P>
<P>(2) Where the beneficiary is rated incompetent, the Veterans Service Center Manager will develop information as to the beneficiary's social, economic and industrial adjustment; appoint (or recommend appointment of) a fiduciary as provided in &#xA7; 13.100 of this chapter; select a method of disbursing payment as provided in &#xA7; 13.100 of this chapter, or in the case of a married beneficiary, appoint the beneficiary's spouse to receive payments as provided in &#xA7; 13.100 of this chapter; and authorize disbursement of the benefit.
</P>
<P>(3) If in the course of fulfilling the responsibilities assigned in paragraph (b)(2) the Veterans Service Center Manager develops evidence indicating that the beneficiary may be capable of administering the funds payable without limitation, he or she will refer that evidence to the rating agency with a statement as to his or her findings. The rating agency will consider this evidence, together with all other evidence of record, to determine whether its prior determination of incompetency should remain in effect. Reexamination may be requested as provided in &#xA7; 3.327(a) if necessary to properly evaluate the beneficiary's mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Medical opinion.</I> Unless the medical evidence is clear, convincing and leaves no doubt as to the person's incompetency, the rating agency will make no determination of incompetency without a definite expression regarding the question by the responsible medical authorities. Considerations of medical opinions will be in accordance with the principles in paragraph (a) of this section. Determinations relative to incompetency should be based upon all evidence of record and there should be a consistent relationship between the percentage of disability, facts relating to commitment or hospitalization and the holding of incompetency.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Presumption in favor of competency.</I> Where reasonable doubt arises regarding a beneficiary's mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, including the disbursement of funds without limitation, such doubt will be resolved in favor of competency (see &#xA7; 3.102 on reasonable doubt).
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Due process.</I> Whenever it is proposed to make an incompetency determination, the beneficiary will be notified of the proposed action and of the right to a hearing as provided in &#xA7; 3.103. Such notice is not necessary if the beneficiary has been declared incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction or if a guardian has been appointed for the beneficiary based upon a court finding of incompetency. If a hearing is requested it must be held prior to a rating decision of incompetency. Failure or refusal of the beneficiary after proper notice to request or cooperate in such a hearing will not preclude a rating decision based on the evidence of record.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.355 Testamentary capacity for insurance purposes.</HEAD>
<P>When cases are referred to a rating agency involving the testamentary capacity of the insured to execute designations or changes of beneficiary, or designations or changes of option, the following considerations will apply:
</P>
<P>(a) Testamentary capacity is that degree of mental capacity necessary to enable a person to perform a testamentary act. This, in general, requires that the testator reasonably comprehend the nature and significance of his act, that is, the subject and extent of his disposition, recognition of the object of his bounty, and appreciation of the consequence of his act, uninfluenced by any material delusion as to the property or persons involved.
</P>
<P>(b) Due consideration should be given to all facts of record, with emphasis being placed on those facts bearing upon the mental condition of the testator (insured) at the time or nearest the time he executed the designation or change. In this connection, consideration should be given to lay as well as medical evidence.
</P>
<P>(c) Lack of testamentary capacity should not be confused with insanity or mental incompetence. An insane person might have a lucid interval during which he would possess testamentary capacity. On the other hand, a sane person might suffer a temporary mental aberration during which he would not possess testamentary capacity. There is a general but rebuttable presumption that every testator possesses testamentary capacity. Therefore, reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of testamentary capacity.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.356 Conditions which determine permanent incapacity for self-support.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Basic determinations.</I> A child must be shown to be permanently incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical defect at the date of attaining the age of 18 years.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Rating criteria.</I> Rating determinations will be made solely on the basis of whether the child is permanently incapable of self-support through his own efforts by reason of physical or mental defects. The question of permanent incapacity for self-support is one of fact for determination by the rating agency on competent evidence of record in the individual case. Rating criteria applicable to disabled veterans are not controlling. Principal factors for consideration are:
</P>
<P>(1) The fact that a claimant is earning his or her own support is prima facie evidence that he or she is not incapable of self-support. Incapacity for self-support will not be considered to exist when the child by his or her own efforts is provided with sufficient income for his or her reasonable support.
</P>
<P>(2) A child shown by proper evidence to have been permanently incapable of self-support prior to the date of attaining the age of 18 years, may be so held at a later date even though there may have been a short intervening period or periods when his or her condition was such that he or she was employed, provided the cause of incapacity is the same as that upon which the original determination was made and there were no intervening diseases or injuries that could be considered as major factors. Employment which was only casual, intermittent, tryout, unsuccessful, or terminated after a short period by reason of disability, should not be considered as rebutting permanent incapability of self-support otherwise established.
</P>
<P>(3) It should be borne in mind that employment of a child prior or subsequent to the delimiting age may or may not be a normal situation, depending on the educational progress of the child, the economic situation of the family, indulgent attitude of parents, and the like. In those cases where the extent and nature of disability raises some doubt as to whether they would render the average person incapable of self-support, factors other than employment are for consideration. In such cases there should be considered whether the daily activities of the child in the home and community are equivalent to the activities of employment of any nature within the physical or mental capacity of the child which would provide sufficient income for reasonable support. Lack of employment of the child either prior to the delimiting age or thereafter should not be considered as a major factor in the determination to be made, unless it is shown that it was due to physical or mental defect and not to mere disinclination to work or indulgence of relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>(4) The capacity of a child for self-support is not determinable upon employment afforded solely upon sympathetic or charitable considerations and which involved no actual or substantial rendition of services.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.358 Compensation for disability or death from hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, examinations or vocational rehabilitation training (&#xA7; 3.800).</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This section applies to claims received by VA before October 1, 1997. If it is determined that there is additional disability resulting from a disease or injury or aggravation of an existing disease or injury suffered as a result of hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, examination, or vocational rehabilitation training, compensation will be payable for such additional disability. For claims received by VA on or after October 1, 1997, see &#xA7; 3.361.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Additional disability.</I> In determining that additional disability exists, the following considerations will govern:
</P>
<P>(1) The veteran's physical condition immediately prior to the disease or injury on which the claim for compensation is based will be compared with the subsequent physical condition resulting from the disease or injury, each body part involved being considered separately.
</P>
<P>(i) As applied to examinations, the physical condition prior to the disease or injury will be the condition at time of beginning the physical examination as a result of which the disease or injury was sustained.
</P>
<P>(ii) As applied to medical or surgical treatment, the physical condition prior to the disease or injury will be the condition which the specific medical or surgical treatment was designed to relieve.
</P>
<P>(2) Compensation will not be payable under this section for the continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury for which the hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or examination was furnished, unless VA's failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in the diagnosis or treatment of the disease or injury caused additional disability or death that probably would have been prevented by proper diagnosis or treatment. Compensation will not be payable under this section for the continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury for which vocational rehabilitation training was provided.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Cause.</I> In determining whether such additional disability resulted from a disease or an injury or an aggravation of an existing disease or injury suffered as a result of training, hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, the following considerations will govern:
</P>
<P>(1) It will be necessary to show that the additional disability is actually the result of such disease or injury or an aggravation of an existing disease or injury and not merely coincidental therewith.
</P>
<P>(2) The mere fact that aggravation occurred will not suffice to make the additional disability compensable in the absence of proof that it resulted from disease or injury or an aggravation of an existing disease or injury suffered as the result of training, hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or examination.
</P>
<P>(3) Compensation is not payable for the necessary consequences of medical or surgical treatment or examination properly administered with the express or implied consent of the veteran, or, in appropriate cases, the veteran's representative. &#x201C;Necessary consequences&#x201D; are those which are certain to result from, or were intended to result from, the examination or medical or surgical treatment administered. Consequences otherwise certain or intended to result from a treatment will not be considered uncertain or unintended solely because it had not been determined at the time consent was given whether that treatment would in fact be administered.
</P>
<P>(4) When the proximate cause of the injury suffered was the veteran's willful misconduct or failure to follow instructions, it will bar him (or her) from receipt of compensation hereunder except in the case of incompetent veterans.
</P>
<P>(5) Compensation for disability resulting from the pursuit of vocational rehabilitation is not payable unless there is established a direct (proximate) causal connection between the injury or aggravation of an existing injury and some essential activity or function which is within the scope of the vocational rehabilitation course, not necessarily limited to activities or functions specifically designated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the individual case, since ordinarily it is not to be expected that each and every different function and act of a veteran pursuant to his or her course of training will be particularly specified in the outline of the course or training program. For example, a disability resulting from the use of an item of mechanical or other equipment is within the purview of the statute if training in its use is implicit within the prescribed program or course outlined or if its use is implicit in the performance of some task or operation the trainee must learn to perform, although such use may not be especially mentioned in the training program. In determining whether the element of direct or proximate causation is present, it remains necessary for a distinction to be made between an injury arising out of an act performed in pursuance of the course of training, that is, a required &#x201C;learning activity&#x201D;, and one arising out of an activity which is incident to, related to, or coexistent with the pursuit of the program of training. For a case to fall within the statute there must have been sustained an injury which, but for the performance of a &#x201C;learning activity&#x201D; in the prescribed course of training, would not have been sustained. A meticulous examination into all the circumstances is required, including a consideration of the time and place of the incident producing the injury.
</P>
<P>(6) Nursing home care furnished under section 1720 of title 38, United States Code is not hospitalization within the meaning of this section. Such a nursing home is an independent contractor and, accordingly, its agents and employees are not to be deemed agents and employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs. If additional disability results from medical or surgical treatment or examination through negligence or other wrongful acts or omissions on the part of such a nursing home, its employees, or its agents, entitlement does not exist under this section unless there was an act or omission on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs independently giving rise to such entitlement and such acts on the part of both proximately caused the additional disability.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.361 Benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) for additional disability or death due to hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy program.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Claims subject to this section</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (2), this section applies to claims received by VA on or after October 1, 1997. This includes original claims and claims to reopen or otherwise readjudicate a previous claim for benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151 or its predecessors. The effective date of benefits is subject to the provisions of &#xA7; 3.400(i). For claims received by VA before October 1, 1997, see &#xA7; 3.358.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Compensated Work Therapy.</I> With respect to claims alleging disability or death due to compensated work therapy, this section applies to claims that were pending before VA on November 1, 2000, or that were received by VA after that date. The effective date of benefits is subject to the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.114(a) and 3.400(i), and shall not be earlier than November 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Determining whether a veteran has an additional disability.</I> To determine whether a veteran has an additional disability, VA compares the veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy (CWT) program upon which the claim is based to the veteran's condition after such care, treatment, examination, services, or program has stopped. VA considers each involved body part or system separately.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Establishing the cause of additional disability or death.</I> Claims based on additional disability or death due to hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination must meet the causation requirements of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Claims based on additional disability or death due to training and rehabilitation services or compensated work therapy program must meet the causation requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Actual causation required.</I> To establish causation, the evidence must show that the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination resulted in the veteran's additional disability or death. Merely showing that a veteran received care, treatment, or examination and that the veteran has an additional disability or died does not establish cause.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury.</I> Hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination cannot cause the continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury for which the care, treatment, or examination was furnished unless VA's failure to timely diagnose and properly treat the disease or injury proximately caused the continuance or natural progress. The provision of training and rehabilitation services or CWT program cannot cause the continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury for which the services were provided.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Veteran's failure to follow medical instructions.</I> Additional disability or death caused by a veteran's failure to follow properly given medical instructions is not caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Establishing the proximate cause of additional disability or death.</I> The proximate cause of disability or death is the action or event that directly caused the disability or death, as distinguished from a remote contributing cause.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Care, treatment, or examination.</I> To establish that carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on VA's part in furnishing hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination proximately caused a veteran's additional disability or death, it must be shown that the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination caused the veteran's additional disability or death (as explained in paragraph (c) of this section); and
</P>
<P>(i) VA failed to exercise the degree of care that would be expected of a reasonable health care provider; or
</P>
<P>(ii) VA furnished the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination without the veteran's or, in appropriate cases, the veteran's representative's informed consent. To determine whether there was informed consent, VA will consider whether the health care providers substantially complied with the requirements of &#xA7; 17.32 of this chapter. Minor deviations from the requirements of &#xA7; 17.32 of this chapter that are immaterial under the circumstances of a case will not defeat a finding of informed consent. Consent may be express (<I>i.e.</I>, given orally or in writing) or implied under the circumstances specified in &#xA7; 17.32(b) of this chapter, as in emergency situations.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Events not reasonably foreseeable.</I> Whether the proximate cause of a veteran's additional disability or death was an event not reasonably foreseeable is in each claim to be determined based on what a reasonable health care provider would have foreseen. The event need not be completely unforeseeable or unimaginable but must be one that a reasonable health care provider would not have considered to be an ordinary risk of the treatment provided. In determining whether an event was reasonably foreseeable, VA will consider whether the risk of that event was the type of risk that a reasonable health care provider would have disclosed in connection with the informed consent procedures of &#xA7; 17.32 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Training and rehabilitation services or compensated work therapy program.</I> To establish that the provision of training and rehabilitation services or a CWT program proximately caused a veteran's additional disability or death, it must be shown that the veteran's participation in an essential activity or function of the training, services, or CWT program provided or authorized by VA proximately caused the disability or death. The veteran must have been participating in such training, services, or CWT program provided or authorized by VA as part of an approved rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 or as part of a CWT program under 38 U.S.C. 1718. It need not be shown that VA approved that specific activity or function, as long as the activity or function is generally accepted as being a necessary component of the training, services, or CWT program that VA provided or authorized.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Department employees and facilities.</I> (1) A <I>Department employee is an individual</I>&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(i) Who is appointed by the Department in the civil service under title 38, United States Code, or title 5, United States Code, as an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105;

<P>(f) <I>Activities that are not hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished by a Department employee or in a Department facility.</I> The following are not hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished by a Department employee or in a Department facility within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. 1151(a):
</P>
<P>(1) Hospital care or medical services furnished under a contract made under 38 U.S.C. 1703.

</P>
<P>(3) Hospital care or medical services, including examination, provided under 38 U.S.C. 8153 in a facility over which the Secretary does not have direct jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151 for a veteran's death. (1) Death before January 1, 1957.</I> The benefit payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) to an eligible survivor for a veteran's death occurring before January 1, 1957, is death compensation. See &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.5(b)(2) and 3.702 for the right to elect dependency and indemnity compensation.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Death after December 31, 1956.</I> The benefit payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) to an eligible survivor for a veteran's death occurring after December 31, 1956, is dependency and indemnity compensation.

<P>A permanent and total disability rating in effect during hospitalization will not be discontinued before hospital discharge on the basis of a change in classification from active. At hospital discharge, the permanent and total rating will be discontinued unless (a) the medical evidence does not support a finding of complete arrest (&#xA7; 3.375), or (b) where complete arrest is shown but the medical authorities recommend that employment not be resumed or be resumed only for short hours (not more than 4 hours a day for a 5-day week). If either of the two aforementioned conditions is met, discontinuance will be deferred pending examination in 6 months. Although complete arrest may be established upon that examination, the permanent and total rating may be extended for a further period of 6 months provided the veteran's employment is limited to short hours as recommended by the medical authorities (not more than 4 hours a day for a 5-day week). Similar extensions may be granted under the same conditions at the end of 12 and 18 months periods. At the expiration of 24 months after hospitalization, the case will be considered under &#xA7; 3.321(b) if continued short hours of employment is recommended or if other evidence warrants submission.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.381 Service connection of dental conditions for treatment purposes.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) will adjudicate a claim for service connection of a dental condition for treatment purposes after the Veterans Health Administration determines a veteran meets the basic eligibility requirements of &#xA7; 17.161 of this chapter and requests VBA make a determination on questions that include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Former Prisoner of War status;
</P>
<P>(2) Whether the veteran has a compensable or noncompensable service-connected dental condition or disability;
</P>
<P>(3) Whether the dental condition or disability is a result of combat wounds;
</P>
<P>(4) Whether the dental condition or disability is a result of service trauma; or
</P>
<P>(5) Whether the veteran is totally disabled due to a service-connected disability.
</P>
<P>(b) Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease are not compensable disabilities, but may nevertheless be service connected solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for outpatient dental treatment as provided for in &#xA7; 17.161 of this chapter. These conditions and other dental conditions or disabilities that are noncompensably rated under &#xA7; 4.150 of this chapter may be service connected for purposes of Class II or Class II (a) dental treatment under &#xA7; 17.161 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(c) The rating activity will consider each defective or missing tooth and each disease of the teeth and periodontal tissues separately to determine whether the condition was incurred or aggravated in line of duty during active service
</P>
<P>(d) In determining service connection, the condition of teeth and periodontal tissues at the time of entry into active duty will be considered. Treatment during service, including filling or extraction of a tooth, or placement of a prosthesis, will not be considered evidence of aggravation of a condition that was noted at entry, unless additional pathology developed after 180 days or more of active service.
</P>
<P>(e) The following principles apply to dental conditions noted at entry and treated during service:
</P>
<P>(1) Teeth noted as normal at entry will be service-connected if they were filled or extracted after 180 days or more of active service.
</P>
<P>(2) Teeth noted as filled at entry will be service-connected if they were extracted, or if the existing filling was replaced, after 180 days or more of active service.
</P>
<P>(3) Teeth noted as carious but restorable at entry will not be service-connected on the basis that they were filled during service. However, new caries that developed 180 days or more after such a tooth was filled will be service-connected.
</P>
<P>(4) Teeth noted as carious but restorable at entry, whether or not filled, will be service-connected if extraction was required after 180 days or more of active service.
</P>
<P>(5) Teeth noted at entry as non-restorable will not be service-connected, regardless of treatment during service.
</P>
<P>(6) Teeth noted as missing at entry will not be service connected, regardless of treatment during service.
</P>
<P>(f) The following will not be considered service-connected for treatment purposes:
</P>
<P>(1) Calculus;
</P>
<P>(2) Acute periodontal disease;
</P>
<P>(3) Third molars, unless disease or pathology of the tooth developed after 180 days or more of active service, or was due to combat or in-service trauma; and
</P>
<P>(4) Impacted or malposed teeth, and other developmental defects, unless disease or pathology of these teeth developed after 180 days or more of active service.
</P>
<P>(g) Teeth extracted because of chronic periodontal disease will be service-connected only if they were extracted after 180 days or more of active service.

<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Pension is subject to reduction as specified below when a veteran who has neither spouse, child nor dependent parent is hospitalized, unless the veteran is hospitalized for Hansen's disease. The provisions of this section apply to initial periods of hospitalization and to readmissions following discharge from a prior period of hospitalization. If the veteran is hospitalized for observation and examination, the date treatment began is considered the date of admission. Special rules governing discontinuance of aid and attendance allowance are contained in &#xA7; 3.552. Except as otherwise indicated the terms &#x201C;hospitalized&#x201D; and &#x201C;hospitalization&#x201D; in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.551 through 3.556 mean:

The rate payable will be reduced effective the first of the seventh calendar month to $30 monthly or 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable, whichever is greater. The reduced rate will be effective the first day of the seventh calendar month following admission. Payment of the amount withheld may be made on termination of hospitalization, as provided in &#xA7; 3.556. (Sec. 306(b))
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Readmission following regular discharge.</I> Where a veteran has been given an approved discharge or release, readmission the next day to the same or any other VA institution begins a new period of hospitalization, unless the veteran was released for purposes of admission to another VA institution.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Readmission following irregular discharge.</I> When a veteran whose award is subject to reduction under this paragraph has been discharged or released from a VA institution against medical advice or as a result of disciplinary action, reentry within 6 months from the date of previous admission constitutes a continuation of that period of hospitalization and the award will not be reduced prior to the first day of the seventh calendar month following the month of original admission, exclusive of authorized absences.

Transfers from VA-furnished nursing home or domiciliary care to VA-furnished hospital care then back to nursing home or domiciliary care shall be considered as continuous nursing home or domiciliary care provided the period of hospitalization does not exceed six months. Similarly, if a veteran is transferred from domiciliary or nursing home to a VA hospital and dies while so hospitalized, the entire period of VA care shall be considered as domiciliary or nursing home care.

Also, for purposes of that paragraph, periods of treatment or care of 60 total days will be considered two calendar months of hospitalization and periods of 90 total days considered three calendar months, exclusive of authorized absences in excess of 96 hours.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Proof of dependents.</I> The veteran will be considered to have neither spouse, child nor dependent parent in the absence of satisfactory proof. Statements contained in the claims folder concerning the existence of such dependents will be considered a prima facie showing. If the necessary evidence is not received: (1) Within 60 days after the date of request where the award is subject to reduction under paragraph (b) of this section, or (2) prior to the effective date of reduction under paragraph (c) of this section, the veteran's award will be reduced on the basis of no dependents.

<P>(i) <I>Certain beneficiaries receiving Medicaid-covered nursing home care.</I> This paragraph (i) applies to a veteran without a spouse or child, to a surviving spouse without a child, and to a surviving child. Effective November 5, 1990, and terminating on the date provided in 38 U.S.C. 5503(d)(7), if such a beneficiary is receiving Medicaid-covered nursing home care, no pension or survivors pension in excess of $90 per month will be paid to or for the beneficiary for any period after the month in which the Medicaid payments begin. A beneficiary is not liable for any pension paid in excess of the $90 per month by reason of the Secretary's inability or failure to reduce payments, unless that inability or failure is the result of willful concealment, by the beneficiary, of information necessary to make that reduction.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.552 Adjustment of allowance for aid and attendance.</HEAD>
<P>(a)(1) When a veteran who is already entitled to the aid and attendance allowance is hospitalized, the additional compensation or increased pension for aid and attendance shall be discontinued as provided in paragraph (b) of this section except as to disabilities specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (See paragraph (k) of this section for rules applicable to a veteran who establishes entitlement to the aid and attendance allowance on or after date of admission to hospitalization).
</P>
<P>(2) The allowance for aid and attendance will be continued during hospitalization where the disability is paraplegia involving paralysis of both lower extremities together with loss of anal and bladder sphincter control, or Hansen's disease, except where discontinuance is required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, in pension cases only, the aid and attendance allowance will be continued where the pensionable disability is blindness (visual acuity
<FR>5/200</FR> or less) or concentric contraction of visual field to 5 degrees or less. Awards are, however, subject to the provisions of &#xA7; 3.551 (except where the disabling condition is Hansen's disease) .
</P>
<P>(3) Additional compensation for dependents under &#xA7; 3.4(b)(2) is payable during hospitalization in addition to the rates authorized by this section. The rates specified will also be increased by amounts authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) based on independently ratable disability, subject to the statutory ceiling on the total amount of compensation payable as set forth in &#xA7; 3.350(a).
</P>
<P>(b)(1) Where a veteran is admitted for hospitalization on or after October 1, 1964, the additional compensation or increased pension for aid and attendance will be discontinued effective the last day of the month following the month in which the veteran is admitted for hospitalization at the expense of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>(2) When a veteran is hospitalized at the expense of the United States Government, the additional aid and attendance allowance authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1114(r)(1) or (2) or 38 U.S.C. 1114(t) will be discontinued effective the last day of the month following the month in which the veteran is admitted for hospitalization.
</P>
<P>(3) Where a veteran affected by the provisions of paragraph (b) (1) and (2) or paragraph (k) of this section is discharged or released from the hospital against medical advice or as the result of disciplinary action, and is readmitted to such hospitalization within 6 months after that date, the allowance, additional compensation, or increased pension will be discontinued effective the day preceding the date of readmission. A readmission 6 months or more after such discharge or release will be considered as a new admission.
</P>
<P>(c) Reduction will not be made where the same monthly rate of compensation would be payable without consideration of need for regular aid and attendance. This can only be determined after careful review of the current maximum entitlement without regard to any amount for aid and attendance.
</P>
<P>(d) Where entitlement by reason of need for regular aid and attendance is the basis of the monthly rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(1) the award will be reduced to the rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).
</P>
<P>(e) Where a veteran is in receipt of section 306 pension, the aid and attendance allowance shall be reduced to the housebound rate of $61 monthly (or $76.25 if the veteran was age 78 or older on December 31, 1978). Where a veteran is in receipt of old-law pension, the total amount payable shall be reduced to $100 monthly. Where a veteran is in receipt of improved pension, the applicable aid and attendance rate shall be reduced to the otherwise applicable rate under 38 U.S.C. 1521(e). No reduction shall be made, however, for any case involving the disabilities specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(f) Where entitlement to the rate in 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) is based in part on need for regular aid and attendance reduction because of being hospitalized will be to the rate payable for the other conditions shown.
</P>
<P>(g) Where a veteran entitled to one of the rates under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l), (m), or (n) by reason of anatomical losses or losses of use of extremities, blindness (visual acuity 5/200 or less or light perception only), or anatomical loss of both eyes is being paid compensation at the rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) because of entitlement to another rate under section 1114(l) on account of need for aid and attendance, the compensation will be reduced while hospitalized to the following:
</P>
<P>(1) If entitlement is under section 1114(l) and in addition there is need for regular aid and attendance for another disability, the award during hospitalization will be at the rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) since the disability requiring aid and attendance is 100 percent disabling.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1114(p))
</PARAUTH>
<P>(2) If entitlement is under section 1114(m), at the rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(n).
</P>
<P>(3) If entitlement is under section 1114(n), the rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) would be continued, since the disability previously causing the need for regular aid and attendance would then be totally disabling entitling the veteran to the maximum rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(p).
</P>
<P>(h) If, because of blindness, a veteran requires regular aid and attendance, but has better vision than &#x201C;light perception only&#x201D; the award under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) will be reduced while hospitalized to the rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(1).
</P>
<P>(i) If the disability meets the aid and attendance requirements of 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) and the intermediate or next higher rate was assigned for disability independently ratable at 50 percent or 100 percent, the award based on such entitlement will be reduced because of hospitalization to the amount payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).
</P>
<P>(j) The section 306 pension aid and attendance allowance authorized by &#xA7; 3.252(f) is subject to reduction for hospitalization under the provisions of this section in the same manner as the regular section 306 pension aid and attendance allowance. The amount payable shall not be reduced to less than the housebound rate of $61 monthly (or $76.25 monthly if the veteran was age 78 or older on December 31, 1978).
</P>
<P>(k)(1) This paragraph is applicable to hospitalized veterans who were not entitled to the aid and attendance allowance prior to hospital admission but who establish entitlement to it on or after the date of hospital admission.
</P>
<P>(2) If the effective date of entitlement to the aid and attendance allowance is on or after the date of admission to hospitalization, the aid and attendance allowance shall not be paid until the date of discharge or release from hospitalization, unless the aid and attendance allowance is based on a disability specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the aid and attendance allowance is based on a disability specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the aid and attendance allowance shall be paid during hospitalization.
</P>
<P>(3) If the aid and attendance allowance is not payable to a veteran under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the veteran shall receive the appropriate reduced rate under paragraphs (d) through (j) of this section while hospitalized.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.556 Adjustment on discharge or release.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Temporary Absence&#x2014;30 days.</I> (1) Where a competent veteran whose award was reduced under &#xA7; 3.551(b) is placed on non-bed care status or other authorized absence of 30 days or more the full monthly rate, excluding any allowance for regular aid and attendance, will be restored effective the date of reduction. The full monthly rate for an incompetent veteran, or for a competent veteran whose pension was reduced under &#xA7; 3.551(c), will be restored effective the date of departure from the hospital unless it is determined that apportionment for a spouse should be continued. In all instances, any allowance for regular aid and attendance will be restored effective the date of departure from the hospital.
</P>
<P>(2) Upon the veteran's return to the hospital, an award which is subject to reduction under &#xA7; 3.551 (b) or (c) will again be reduced effective the date of the veteran's return to the hospital. In all instances, any allowance for regular aid and attendance will be discontinued, if in order, effective the date of the veteran's return to the hospital.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Temporary absence&#x2014;less than 30 days.</I> A temporary absence of less than 30 days, including the day of departure, will not require adjustment of the award. This applies to any approved absence. Any allowance for regular aid and attendance for such periods will be authorized after the veteran has been discharged from the hospital.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Adjustment based on need.</I> Where an award of pension was reduced under &#xA7; 3.551(c), the full rate covering absences of less than 30 days may be restored, subject to prior payments, prior to discharge from hospitalization at the request of the Director of the hospital, center or domiciliary, where this action is necessary to meet the veteran's financial needs, if the veteran has been hospitalized for more than 6 months and the periods of absence exceed a total of 30 days.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Irregular discharge.</I> When a competent veteran is given an irregular discharge, the full rate will be restored effective the date of release from the hospital. Payment of any amount withheld under &#xA7; 3.551(b) will not be authorized until the expiration of 6 months after termination of hospitalization unless the prior release is changed to a regular release. However, amounts not paid under paragraph (c) of this section covering absence of less than 30 days where the award was reduced under &#xA7; 3.551(c) will be authorized immediately.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Regular discharge.</I> When a veteran, either competent or incompetent, is given a regular discharge or release, the full rate, including any allowance for regular aid and attendance will be restored effective the date of release from the hospital, subject to prior payments. The award will be based on the most recent rating and, where the award was reduced under &#xA7; 3.551(b), will include, in the case of a competent veteran, any amounts withheld because of hospitalization. The amount withheld for an incompetent veteran will not be authorized until the expiration of 6 months following a rating of competency by VA. Any institutional award will be discontinued effective date of last payment, as provided in &#xA7; 3.501(j). Where an apportionment made under &#xA7; 3.551(c) is not continued, the apportionment will be discontinued effective the day preceding the date of the veteran's release from the hospital, or, if adjusted, effective the date of the veteran's release from the hospital, unless an overpayment would result. In the excepted cases, the awards to the veteran and apportionee will be adjusted as of date of last payment.

<P>(f) <I>Types of discharges.</I> A discharge is considered regular if it is granted because of having received maximum hospital benefits.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.654 Active service pay.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Pension, compensation, or retirement pay will be discontinued under the circumstances stated in &#xA7; 3.700(a)(1) for any period for which the veteran received active service pay. For the purposes of this section, active service pay means pay received for active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty training.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Active duty or active duty for training.</I> (1) Where the veteran receives active service pay as a result of returning to active duty status or active duty for training as described in &#xA7; 3.6(c), with the exception of annual active duty for training typically performed 15 days each year by reservists and members of the National Guard and Active Duty for Special Work to receive training (see paragraph (c) of this section), the award will be discontinued effective the day preceding reentrance into active duty or active duty for training status. If the exact date is not known, payments will be discontinued effective date of last payment, and the effective date of discontinuance will be adjusted to the day preceding reentrance when the date of reentrance has been ascertained from the service department.
</P>
<P>(2) Payments, if otherwise in order, will be resumed effective the day following release from active duty or active duty for training if notice from the Department of Defense of such release or a claim for recommencement of payments is received within one year from the date of such release; otherwise, payments will be resumed effective one year prior to the date of receipt of a new claim. Prior determinations of service connection will not be disturbed except as provided in &#xA7; 3.105. Compensation will be resumed based on the combined evaluation in effect at the time payments were discontinued. If a reduction in evaluation that lowers the combined evaluation is considered warranted, the provisions of &#xA7; 3.105(e) will apply. If a disability is incurred or aggravated, or a service-connected disability worsens in the most recent period of service, compensation for that disability or increase in disability cannot be paid unless a claim therefor is filed.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Training duty.</I> Prospective adjustment of awards may be made where the veteran waives his or her Department of Veterans Affairs benefit covering anticipated receipt of active service pay because of expected periods of active duty for training (annual active duty for training typically performed 15 days each year by reservists and members of the National Guard or Active Duty for Special Work to receive training) or inactive duty training. Where readjustment is in order because service pay was not received for expected training duty, retroactive payments may be authorized if a claim for readjustment is received within one year after the end of the fiscal year for which payments were waived.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.655 Failure to report for Department of Veterans Affairs examination.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> When entitlement or continued entitlement to a benefit cannot be established or confirmed without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination, or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section as appropriate. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, death of an immediate family member, etc. For purposes of this section, the terms <I>examination</I> and <I>reexamination</I> include periods of hospital observation when required by VA.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Original or supplemental claim, or claim for increase.</I> When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. When the examination was scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a supplemental claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Running award.</I> (1) When a claimant fails to report for a reexamination and the issue is continuing entitlement, VA shall issue a pretermination notice advising the payee that payment for the disability or disabilities for which the reexamination was scheduled will be discontinued or, if a minimum evaluation is established in part 4 of this title or there is an evaluation protected under &#xA7; 3.951(b) of this part, reduced to the lower evaluation. Such notice shall also include the prospective date of discontinuance or reduction, the reason therefor and a statement of the claimant's procedural and appellate rights. The claimant shall be allowed 60 days to indicate his or her willingness to report for a reexamination or to present evidence that payment for the disability or disabilities for which the reexamination was scheduled should not be discontinued or reduced.
</P>
<P>(2) If there is no response within 60 days, or if the evidence submitted does not establish continued entitlement, payment for such disability or disabilities shall be discontinued or reduced as of the date indicated in the pretermination notice or the date of last payment, whichever is later.
</P>
<P>(3) If notice is received that the claimant is willing to report for a reexamination before payment has been discontinued or reduced, action to adjust payment shall be deferred. The reexamination shall be rescheduled and the claimant notified that failure to report for the rescheduled examination shall be cause for immediate discontinuance or reduction of payment. When a claimant fails to report for such rescheduled examination, payment shall be reduced or discontinued as of the date of last payment and shall not be further adjusted until a VA examination has been conducted and the report reviewed.
</P>
<P>(4) If within 30 days of a pretermination notice issued under paragraph (c)(1) of this section the claimant requests a hearing, action to adjust payment shall be deferred as set forth in &#xA7; 3.105(i)(1) of this part. If a hearing is requested more than 30 days after such pretermination notice but before the proposed date of discontinuance or reduction, a hearing shall be scheduled, but payment shall nevertheless be discontinued or reduced as of the date proposed in the pretermination notice or date of last payment, whichever is later, unless information is presented which warrants a different determination. When the claimant has also expressed willingness to report for an examination, however, the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply.

<P>(a) <I>Reduction or discontinuance</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> A veteran, surviving spouse or child who is receiving pension, or a parent who is receiving compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation must notify the Department of Veterans Affairs of any material change or expected change in his or her income or other circumstances which would affect his or her entitlement to receive, or the rate of, the benefit being paid. Such notice must be furnished when the recipient acquires knowledge that he or she will begin to receive additional income or when his or her marital or dependency status changes. In pension claims subject to &#xA7; 3.252(b) or &#xA7; 3.274 and in compensation claims subject to &#xA7; 3.250(a)(2), notice must be furnished of any material increase in corpus of the estate or net worth.

Except as noted in this subparagraph for section 306 or old-law pension, where the dependency of another person ceased on or after October 1, 1982, due to marriage, annulment, divorce or death, the reduction or discontinuance shall be effective the last day of the month in which dependency ceased.

</P>
<P>(c) <I>Increases; change in status.</I> Where there is change in the payee's marital status or status of dependents which would permit payment at a higher rate and the change in status is by reason of the claimant's marriage or birth or adoption of a child, the effective date of the increase will be the date of the event if the required evidence is received within 1 year of the event.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.666 Incarcerated beneficiaries and fugitive felons&#x2014;pension.</HEAD>
<P>If any individual to or for whom pension is being paid under a public or private law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs is imprisoned in a Federal, State or local penal institution as the result of conviction of a felony or misdemeanor, such pension payments will be discontinued effective on the 61st day of imprisonment following conviction. The payee will be informed of his or her rights and the rights of dependents to payments while he or she is imprisoned as well as the conditions under which payments to him or to her may be resumed on his or her release from imprisonment. However, no apportionment will be made if the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive felon as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Payments of pension authorized under this section will continue until notice is received by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the imprisonment has terminated.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Disability pension.</I> Payment may be made to the spouse, child or children of a veteran disqualified under this section:
</P>
<P>(1) If the veteran continues to be eligible except for the provisions of this section, and
</P>
<P>(2) If the annual income of the spouse or child is such that death pension would be payable.
</P>
<P>(3) At the rate payable under the death pension law or the rate which the veteran was receiving at the time of imprisonment, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>(4) From the day following the date of discontinuance of payments to the veteran, subject to payments made to the veteran over the same period, if a claim or intent to file a claim as set forth in &#xA7; 3.155(b) is received within 1 year after notice to the veteran as required by this section and any necessary evidence is received within 1 year from the date of request; otherwise payments may not be made for any period prior to the date of receipt of a new claim or intent to file a claim as set forth in &#xA7; 3.155(b).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Death pension.</I> Payment may be made to a child or children where a surviving spouse or child is disqualified under this section:
</P>
<P>(1) If surviving spouse is disqualified to child or children at the rate of death pension payable if there were no such surviving spouse; or
</P>
<P>(2) If a child is disqualified, to a surviving spouse or other child or children at the rate of death pension payable if there were no such child, and
</P>
<P>(3) From the day following the date of discontinuance of payments to the disqualified person, subject to payments made to that person over the same period if evidence of income is received within 1 year after date of request; otherwise payments may not be made for any period prior to the date of receipt of a claim or intent to file a claim as set forth in &#xA7; 3.155(b).
</P>
<P>(4) The income limitation applicable to eligible persons will be that which would apply if the imprisoned person did not exist.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Resumption of pension upon release from incarceration.</I> Pension will be resumed as of the day of release if notice is received within 1 year following release; otherwise resumption will be effective the date of receipt of such notice. Where an award or increased award was made to any other payee based upon the disqualification of the veteran, surviving spouse, or child while in prison, such award will be reduced or discontinued as of date of last payment and pension will be resumed to the released prisoner at a rate which will be the difference, if any, between the total pension payable and the amount which was paid to the other person or persons through the date of last payment and thereafter the full rate.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Veteran entitled to compensation.</I> If an imprisoned veteran is entitled to a lesser rate of disability compensation, it shall be awarded as of the 61st day of imprisonment in lieu of the pension the veteran was receiving if the veteran has neither spouse nor child. If the veteran has a spouse or a child, compensation will be awarded only after the veteran has been furnished an explanation of the effect of electing compensation on the amount available for apportionment. If the veteran then requests compensation, it shall be awarded from the date veteran requests the Department of Veterans Affairs to take such action.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Fugitive felons.</I> (1) Pension is not payable on behalf of a veteran for any period during which he or she is a fugitive felon. Pension or death pension is not payable on behalf of a dependent of a veteran for any period during which the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive felon.
</P>
<P>(2) For purposes of this section, the term <I>fugitive felon</I> means a person who is a fugitive by reason of:
</P>
<P>(i) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or

<P>(ii) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for commission of a felony under Federal or State law.

Following initial determination of the degree of disability recoupment shall not be at a monthly rate in excess of the monthly compensation payable for that degree of disability. For this purpose the term &#x201C;initial determination of the degree of disability&#x201D; means the first regular schedular compensable rating in accordance with the provisions of subpart B, part 4 of this chapter and does not mean a rating based in whole or in part on a need for hospitalization or a period of convalescense. Where entitlement to disability compensation was established prior to September 15, 1981, compensation payable for service-connected disability other than the disability for which disability severance pay was granted will not be reduced for the purpose of recouping disability severance pay. Where entitlement to disability compensation was established on or after September 15, 1981, a veteran may receive disability compensation for disability incurred or aggravated by service prior to the date of receipt of the severance pay, but VA must recoup from that disability compensation an amount equal to the severance pay. Where payment of severance pay was made on or before September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of the severance pay. Where payment of severance pay was made after September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of the severance pay less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay. For members of the Armed Forces who separated under Chapter 61 of title 10, United States Code, on or after January 28, 2008, no recoupment of severance pay will be made for disabilities incurred in line of duty in a combat zone or incurred during performance of duty in combat-related operations as designated by the Department of Defense.

Where payment of separation pay was made on or before September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay. Where payment of separation pay was made after September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay. The Federal income tax withholding amount is the flat withholding rate for Federal income tax withholding.

<P>(ii) The receipt of separation pay does not affect the payment of disability compensation based on a subsequent period of service.

</P>
<P>(iii) Where payment of special separation benefits under 10 U.S.C. 1174a was made on or after December 5, 1991, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of special separation benefits less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay. The Federal income tax withholding amount is the flat withholding rate for Federal income tax withholding.

The surviving spouse may elect to receive benefits based on the death of one such spouse and the election places the right to benefits based on the deaths of other spouses in suspense. The suspension may be lifted at any time by another election based on the death of another spouse.

<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Except as otherwise provided, a person entitled to receive pension or compensation under more than one law or section of a law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs may elect to receive whichever benefit, regardless of whether it is the greater or lesser benefit, even though the election reduces the benefits payable to his or her dependents. Such person may at any time elect or reelect the other benefit. An election by a veteran controls the rights of all dependents in that case. An election by a surviving spouse controls the claims of all children including children over 18 and children not in the custody of the surviving spouse. The election of improved pension by a surviving spouse, however, shall not prejudice the rights of any child receiving an apportionment on December 31, 1978. Termination of a marriage or marital relationship which had been the reason for terminating an award of section 306 or old-law pension does not restore to the surviving spouse the right to receive section 306 or old-law pension.

<P>(a) <I>Right to elect.</I> A person who is eligible for death compensation and who has entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation pursuant to the provisions of &#xA7; 3.5(b)(2) or (3) may receive dependency and indemnity compensation upon the filing of a claim.

Pension compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation may not be paid in such instances by the Department of Veterans Affairs concurrently with compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. Benefits are not payable by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs for disability or death incurred on or after January 1, 1957, based on military service.

<P>(2) <I>Right of reelection.</I> Persons receiving compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs based on death due to military service may elect to receive dependency and indemnity compensation at any time.

On or after September 13, 1960, an award cannot be approved for payment of compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation concurrently with compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs in such instances and an election to receive benefits from either agency is final. See &#xA7; 3.958. There is no right of reelection. (5 U.S.C. 8116(b)) A child who is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation or other benefits independent of the surviving spouse's entitlement may receive such benefits concurrently with payment of FECA benefits to the surviving spouse.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.714 Improved pension elections&#x2014;public assistance beneficiaries.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I> The following definitions are applicable to this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Pensioner.</I> This means a person who was entitled to section 306 or old-law pension, or a dependent of such a person for the purposes of chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code as in effect on December 31, 1978.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Public assistance.</I> This means payments under the following titles of the Social Security Act:
</P>
<P>(i) Title I (Grants to States for Old Age Assistance and Medical Assistance to the Aged).
</P>
<P>(ii) Title X (Grants to States for Aid to the Blind).
</P>
<P>(iii) Title XIV (Grants to States for Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled).
</P>
<P>(iv) Part A of title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children).
</P>
<P>(v) Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind and Disabled).
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Medicaid.</I> This means a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Informed election.</I> The term &#x201C;informed election&#x201D; means an election of improved pension (or a reaffirmation of a previous election of improved pension) after the Department of Veterans Affairs has complied with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>General.</I> In some States only a person in receipt of public assistance is eligible for medicaid. When this is the case the following applies effective January 1, 1979:
</P>
<P>(1) A pensioner may not be required to elect improved pension to receive, or to continue to receive, public assistance; or
</P>
<P>(2) A pensioner may not be denied (or suffer a reduction in the amount of) public assistance by reason of failure or refusal to elect improved pension.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Public assistance deemed to continue.</I> Public assistance (or a supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93&#x2013;233, sec. 13(c)) payable to a pensioner may have been terminated because the pensioner's income increased as a result of electing improved pension. In this instance public assistance (or a supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93&#x2013;233, sec. 13(c)) shall be deemed to have remained payable to a pensioner for each month after December 1978 when the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(1) The pensioner was in receipt of pension for the month of December 1978; and
</P>
<P>(2) The pensioner was in receipt of public assistance (or a supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93&#x2013;233, sec. 13(c)) prior to June 17, 1980, and for the month of December 1978, and
</P>
<P>(3) The pensioner's public assistance payments (or a supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93&#x2013;233, sec. 13(c)) were discontinued because of an increase in income resulting from an election of improved pension.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>End of the deemed period of entitlement to public assistance.</I> The deemed period of entitlement to public assistance (or a supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93&#x2013;233, sec. 13(c)) ends the first calendar month that begins more than 10 days after a pensioner makes an informed election of improved pension. (If the pensioner is unable to make an informed election the informed election may be made by a member of the pensioner's family.) A pensioner who fails to disaffirm a previously made election of improved pension within the time limits set forth in paragraph (e) of this section shall be deemed to have reaffirmed the previous election. This will also end the deemed period of entitlement to public assistance.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Notice of right to make informed election or disaffirm election previously made.</I> The Department of Veterans Affairs shall send a written notice to each pensioner to whom paragraph (b) of this section applies and who is eligible to elect or who has elected improved pension. The notice shall be in clear and understandable language. It shall include the following:
</P>
<P>(1) A description of the consequences to the pensioner (and the pensioner's family if applicable) of losing medicaid eligibility because of an increase in income resulting from electing improved pension; and
</P>
<P>(2) A description of the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section; and
</P>
<P>(3) In the case of a pensioner who has previously elected improved pension, a form for the purpose of enabling the pensioner to disaffirm the previous election of improved pensions; and
</P>
<P>(4) The following provisons of Pub. L. 96&#x2013;272, sec. 310(b)(2)(B):
</P>
<P>(i) That a pensioner has 90 days from the date the notice is mailed to the pensioner to disaffirm a previous election by completing the disaffirmation form and mailing it to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>(ii) That a pensioner who disaffirms a previous election shall receive, beginning the calendar month after the calendar month in which the Department of Veterans Affairs receives the disaffirmation, the amount of pension payable if improved pension had not been elected.
</P>
<P>(iii) That a pensioner who disaffirms a previous election may again elect improved pension but without a right to disaffirm the subsequent election.
</P>
<P>(iv) That a pensioner who disaffirms an election of improved pension shall not be indebted to the United States for the period in which the pensioner received improved pension.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: Pub. L. 96&#x2013;272, sec. 310; 94 Stat. 500)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(f) <I>Notification to the Social Security Administration.</I> The Department of Veterans Affairs shall promptly furnish the Social Security Administration the following information:
</P>
<P>(1) The name and identifying information of each pensioner who disaffirms his or her election of improved pension.
</P>
<P>(2) The name and identifying information of each pensioner who fails to disaffirm and election of improved pension within the 90-day period described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) The name and identifying information of each pensioner who after disaffirming his or her election of improved pension, subsequently reelected improved pension.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.750 Entitlement to concurrent receipt of military retired pay and disability compensation.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definition of military retired pay.</I> For the purposes of this part, military retired pay is payment received by a veteran that is classified as retired pay by the Service Department, including retainer pay, based on the recipient's service as a member of the Armed Forces or as a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Environmental Science Services Administration, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Payment of both military retired pay and disability compensation or improved pension</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Compensation.</I> Subject to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a veteran who is entitled to military retired pay and disability compensation for a service-connected disability rated 50 percent or more, or a combination of service-connected disabilities rated 50 percent or more, under the schedule for rating disabilities (38 CFR part 4, subpart B), is entitled to receive both payments subject to the phase-in period described in paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Chapter 61 disability retirees retiring with 20 or more years of service.</I> Disability retired pay payable under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 61 to a veteran with 20 or more years of creditable service may be paid concurrently with disability compensation to a qualifying veteran subject to the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Any waiver required during the phase-in period under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section; and
</P>
<P>(ii) If the veteran's disability retired pay exceeds the amount of retired pay the veteran would have received had the veteran retired based on length of service, the veteran must waive that excess amount of disability retired pay in order to receive VA disability compensation.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Chapter 61 disability retirees retiring with less than 20 years of service.</I> Veterans who receive disability retired pay under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 61 with less than 20 years of creditable service are not eligible for concurrent receipt.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Improved Pension.</I> A veteran may receive improved pension and military retired pay at the same time without having to waive military retired pay. However, in determining entitlement to improved pension, VA will treat military retired pay in the same manner as countable income from other sources.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Waiver</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>When a waiver is necessary.</I> (i) A waiver of military retired pay is necessary in order to receive disability compensation when a veteran is eligible for both military retired pay and disability compensation but is not eligible under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section to receive both benefits at the same time.
</P>
<P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all veterans who are eligible to receive both military retired pay and disability compensation at the same time under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section must file a waiver in order to receive the maximum allowable amount of disability compensation during the phase-in period. The phase-in period ends on December 31, 2013. After the phase-in period, veterans retired under 10 U.S.C. chapter 61 who are eligible for concurrent receipt must still file a waiver under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
</P>
<PARAUTH TYPE="N">(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1414, 38 U.S.C. 5304, 5305)
</PARAUTH>
<P>(2) <I>When a waiver is not necessary.</I> Unless paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section applies, veterans who are entitled to receive disability compensation based on a VA determination of individual unemployability as well as veterans rated 100-percent disabled under the VA schedule for rating disabilities need not file waivers of military retired pay. The phase-in period does not apply to this group of veterans.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>How to file a waiver of military retired pay.</I> A veteran may request a waiver of military retired pay in any written, signed statement, including a VA form, which reflects a desire to waive all or some military retired pay. The statement must be submitted to VA or to the Federal agency that pays the veteran's military retired pay. VA will treat as a waiver an application for VA compensation filed by a veteran who is entitled to military retired pay.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Elections and the right to reelect either benefit.</I> (1) A veteran who has filed a waiver of military retired pay under this section has elected to receive disability compensation. A veteran may reelect between benefits covered by this section at any time by submitting a written, signed statement to VA or to the Federal agency that pays the veteran's military retired pay.
</P>
<P>(2) An election filed within 1 year from the date of notification of Department of Veterans Affairs entitlement will be considered as &#x201C;timely filed&#x201D; for effective date purposes. See &#xA7; 3.401(e)(1). If the veteran is incompetent, the 1-year period will begin on the date that notification is sent to the next friend or fiduciary. In initial determinations, elections may be applied retroactively if the claimant was not advised of his or her right of election and its effect.

<P>(a) <I>Eligibility for minimum income annuity.</I> The minimum income annuity authorized by Public Law 92&#x2013;425 as amended is payable to a person:
</P>
<P>(1) Whom the Department of Defense or the Department of Transportation has determined meets the eligibility criteria of section 4(a) of Pub. L. 92&#x2013;425 as amended other than section 4(a)(1) and (2); and

</P>
<P>(b) <I>Computation of the minimum income annuity payment</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Annual income.</I> VA will determine a beneficiary's annual income for minimum income annuity purposes under the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.271 and 3.272 of this part for beneficiaries receiving improved pension, or under &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.260 through 3.262 of this part for beneficiaries receiving old law or section 306 pensions, except that the amount of the minimum income annuity will be excluded from the calculation.
</P>
<P>(2) VA will determine the minimum income annuity payment for beneficiaries entitled to improved pension by subtracting the annual income for minimum income annuity purposes from the maximum annual pension rate under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b).
</P>
<P>(3) VA will determine the minimum income annuity payment for beneficiaries receiving old law and section 306 pensions by reducing the maximum annual pension rate under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b) by the amount of the Retired Servicemen's Family Protection Plan benefit, if any, that the beneficiary receives and subtracting from that amount the annual income for minimum income annuity purposes.
</P>
<P>(4) VA will recompute the monthly minimum income annuity payment whenever there is a change to the maximum annual rate of pension in effect under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b), and whenever there is a change in the beneficiary's income.
</P>
<P>(c) An individual otherwise eligible for pension under subchapter III of chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code, or section 306 of the Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978 shall be considered eligible for pension for purposes of determining eligibility for the minimum income annuity even though as a result of adding the amount of the minimum income annuity authorized under Public Law 92&#x2013;425 as amended to any other countable income, no amount of pension is due.
</P>
<P>(d) If the Department of Defense or the Department of Transportation determines that a minimum income annuitant also is entitled to the gratuitous annuity authorized by Pub.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.812 Special allowance payable under section 156 of Pub. L. 97&#x2013;377.</HEAD>
<P>The provisions of this section apply to the payment of a special allowance to certain surviving spouses and children of individuals who died on active duty prior to August 13, 1981, or who died as a result of a service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to August 13, 1981. This special allowance is a replacement for certain social security benefits which were either reduced or terminated by provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Eligibility requirements.</I> (1) A determination must first be made that the person on whose earnings record the claim is based either died on active duty prior to August 13, 1981, or died as a result of a service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to August 13, 1981. For purposes of this determination, character of discharge is not a factor for consideration, and death on active duty subsequent to August 12, 1981, is qualifying provided that the death resulted from a service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to August 13, 1981.
</P>
<P>(2) Once a favorable determination has been made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, determinations as to the age, relationship and school attendance requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of section 156 of Pub. L. 97&#x2013;377 will be made. In making these eligibility determinations VA shall apply the provisions of the Social Security Act, and any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, as in effect during the claimant's period of eligibility. Unless otherwise provided in this section, when issues are raised concerning eligibility or entitlement to this special allowance which cannot be appropriately resolved under the provisions of the Social Security Act, or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the provisions of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, are for application.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Computation of payment rate</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Basic entitlement rate.</I> A basic entitlement rate will be computed for each eligible claimant in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of section 156 of Pub. L. 97&#x2013;377 using data to be provided by the Social Security Administration. This basic entitlement rate will then be used to compute the monthly payment rate as described in paragraphs (b)(2) to (b)(6) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Original or reopened awards to surviving spouses.</I> The monthly payment rate shall be equal to the basic entitlement rate increased by the overall average percentage (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) of each legislative increase in dependency and indemnity compensation rates under 38 U.S.C. 1311 which became effective concurrently with or subsequent to the effective date of the earliest adjustment under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act that was disregarded in computing the basic entitlement rate.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Original and reopened awards to children.</I> The monthly payment rate shall be equal to the basic entitlement rate increased by the overall average percentage (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) of each legislative increase in the rates of educational assistance allowance under 38 U.S.C. 3531(b) which became effective concurrently with or subsequent to the effective date of the earliest adjustment under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act that was disregarded in computing the basic entitlement rate.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Subsequent legislative increases in rates.</I> The monthly rate of special allowance payable to a surviving spouse shall be increased by the same overall average percentage increase (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) and on the same effective date as any legislative increase in the rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 1311. The monthly rate of special allowance payable to a child shall be increased by the same overall average percentage increase (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) and on the same effective date as any legislative increase in the rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 3531(b).
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Amendment of awards.</I> Prompt action shall be taken to amend any award of this special allowance to conform with evidence indicating a change in basic eligibility, any basic entitlement rate, or any effective date previously determined. It is the claimant's responsibility to promptly notify VA of any change in their status or employment which affects eligibility or entitlement.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Rounding of monthly rates.</I> Any monthly rate computed under the provisions of this paragraph, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Claimants not entitled to this special allowance.</I> The following are not entitled to this special allowance for the reasons indicated.
</P>
<P>(1) Claimants eligible for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151. The deaths in such cases are not service-connected.
</P>
<P>(2) Claimants eligible for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1318. The deaths in such cases are not service connected.
</P>
<P>(3) Claimants whose claims are based on an individual's service in:
</P>
<P>(i) The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines while such forces were in the service of the Armed Forces pursuant to the military order of the President dated July 26, 1941, including recognized guerrilla forces (see 38 U.S.C. 107).
</P>
<P>(ii) The Philippine Scouts under section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th Congress (see 38 U.S.C. 107).
</P>
<P>(iii) The commissioned corps of the Public Health Service (specifically excluded by section 156 of Pub. L. 97&#x2013;377), or
</P>
<P>(iv) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (specifically excluded by section 156 of Pub. L. 97&#x2013;377).
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Appellate jurisdiction.</I> VA shall have appellate jurisdiction of all determinations made in connection with this special allowance.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Claims.</I> Claimants must file or submit a complete claim on a paper or electronic form prescribed by the Secretary in order for VA to pay this special allowance. When VA receives an intent to file a claim or inquiries as to eligibility, VA will follow the procedures outlined in &#xA7; 3.155. Otherwise, the date of receipt of the complete claim will be accepted as the date of claim for this special allowance. See &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.150, 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Retroactivity and effective dates.</I> There is no time limit for filing a claim for this special allowance. Upon the filing of a complete claim, benefits shall be payable for all periods of eligibility beginning on or after the first day of the month in which the claimant first became eligible for this special allowance, except that no payment may be made for any period prior to January 1, 1983.

<P>(a) <I>Monthly monetary allowance.</I> VA will pay a monthly monetary allowance under subchapter I of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18, based upon the level of disability determined under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, to or for a person who VA has determined is an individual suffering from spina bifida whose biological mother or father is or was a Vietnam veteran or a veteran with covered service in Korea. Receipt of this allowance will not affect the right of the individual or any related person to receive any other benefit to which he or she may be entitled under any law administered by VA. An individual suffering from spina bifida is entitled to only one monthly allowance under this section, even if the individual's biological father and mother are or were both Vietnam veterans or veterans with covered service in Korea.
</P>
<P>(b) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Definitions</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Vietnam veteran.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term &#x201C;Vietnam veteran&#x201D; means a person who performed active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to the characterization of the person's service. <I>Service in the Republic of Vietnam</I> includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Covered service in Korea.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term &#x201C;veteran with covered service in Korea&#x201D; means a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service in or near the Korean DMZ between September 1, 1967, and August 31, 1971, and who is determined by VA, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to have been exposed to an herbicide agent during such service. Exposure to an herbicide agent will be conceded if the veteran served between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that, as determined by the Department of Defense, operated in or near the Korean DMZ in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Individual.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term &#x201C;individual&#x201D; means a person, regardless of age or marital status, whose biological father or mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who was conceived after the date on which the veteran first served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, or whose biological father or mother is or was a veteran with covered service in Korea and who was conceived after the date on which the veteran first had covered service in Korea as defined in this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of &#xA7; 3.204(a)(1), VA will require the types of evidence specified in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.209 and 3.210 sufficient to establish in the judgment of the Secretary that a person is the biological son or daughter of a Vietnam veteran or a veteran with covered service in Korea.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Spina bifida.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term &#x201C;spina bifida&#x201D; means any form and manifestation of spina bifida except spina bifida occulta.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Disability evaluations.</I> (1) Except as otherwise specified in this paragraph, VA will determine the level of payment as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Level I.</I> The individual walks without braces or other external support as his or her primary means of mobility in the community, has no sensory or motor impairment of the upper extremities, has an IQ of 90 or higher, and is continent of urine and feces without the use of medication or other means to control incontinence.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Level II.</I> Provided that none of the disabilities is severe enough to warrant payment at Level III, and the individual: walks with braces or other external support as his or her primary means of mobility in the community; or, has sensory or motor impairment of the upper extremities, but is able to grasp pen, feed self, and perform self care; or, has an IQ of at least 70 but less than 90; or, requires medication or other means to control the effects of urinary bladder impairment and no more than two times per week is unable to remain dry for at least three hours at a time during waking hours; or, requires bowel management techniques or other treatment to control the effects of bowel impairment but does not have fecal leakage severe or frequent enough to require wearing of absorbent materials at least four days a week; or, has a colostomy that does not require wearing a bag.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Level III.</I> The individual uses a wheelchair as his or her primary means of mobility in the community; or, has sensory or motor impairment of the upper extremities severe enough to prevent grasping a pen, feeding self, and performing self care; or, has an IQ of 69 or less; or, despite the use of medication or other means to control the effects of urinary bladder impairment, at least three times per week is unable to remain dry for three hours at a time during waking hours; or, despite bowel management techniques or other treatment to control the effects of bowel impairment, has fecal leakage severe or frequent enough to require wearing of absorbent materials at least four days a week; or, regularly requires manual evacuation or digital stimulation to empty the bowel; or, has a colostomy that requires wearing a bag.
</P>
<P>(2) If an individual who would otherwise be paid at Level I or II has one or more disabilities, such as blindness, uncontrolled seizures, or renal failure that result either from spina bifida, or from treatment procedures for spina bifida, the Director of the Compensation Service may increase the monthly payment to the level that, in his or her judgment, best represents the extent to which the disabilities resulting from spina bifida limit the individual's ability to engage in ordinary day-to-day activities, including activities outside the home. A Level II or Level III payment will be awarded depending on whether the effects of a disability are of equivalent severity to the effects specified under Level II or Level III.
</P>
<P>(3) VA may accept statements from private physicians, or examination reports from government or private institutions, for the purpose of rating spina bifida claims without further examination, provided the statements or reports are adequate for assessing the level of disability due to spina bifida under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In the absence of adequate medical information, VA will schedule an examination for the purpose of assessing the level of disability.
</P>
<P>(4) VA will pay an individual eligible for a monetary allowance due to spina bifida at Level I unless or until it receives medical evidence supporting a higher payment. When required to reassess the level of disability under paragraph (d)(5) or (d)(6) of this section, VA will pay an individual eligible for this monetary allowance at Level I in the absence of evidence adequate to support a higher level of disability or if the individual fails to report, without good cause, for a scheduled examination. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, death of an immediate family member, etc.
</P>
<P>(5) VA will pay individuals under the age of one year at Level I unless a pediatric neurologist or a pediatric neurosurgeon certifies that, in his or her medical judgment, there is a neurological deficit that will prevent the individual from ambulating, grasping a pen, feeding himself or herself, performing self care, or from achieving urinary or fecal continence. If any of those deficits are present, VA will pay the individual at Level III. In either case, VA will reassess the level of disability when the individual reaches the age of one year.
</P>
<P>(6) VA will reassess the level of payment whenever it receives medical evidence indicating that a change is warranted. For individuals between the ages of one and twenty-one, however, it must reassess the level of payment at least every five years.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Effective dates.</I> Except as otherwise provided, VA will award the monetary allowance for an individual suffering from spina bifida based on an initial claim or supplemental claim as of the date VA received the claim (or the date of birth if the claim is received within 1 year of that date) or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.
</P>
<P>(1) VA will increase benefits as of the earliest date the evidence establishes that the level of severity increased, but only if the beneficiary applies for an increase within one year of that date.
</P>
<P>(2) If a claimant reopens a previously disallowed claim based on corrected military records, VA will award the benefit from the latest of the following dates: the date the veteran or beneficiary applied for a correction of the military records; the date the disallowed claim was filed; or, the date one year before the date of receipt of the reopened claim.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Reductions and discontinuances.</I> VA will generally reduce or discontinue awards according to the facts found except as provided in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.105 and 3.114(b).
</P>
<P>(1) If benefits were paid erroneously because of beneficiary error, VA will reduce or discontinue benefits as of the effective date of the erroneous award.
</P>

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.815 Monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 for an individual with disability from covered birth defects whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran; identification of covered birth defects.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Monthly monetary allowance</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> VA will pay a monthly monetary allowance under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 to or for an individual whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who VA has determined to have disability resulting from one or more covered birth defects. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of the monetary allowance paid will be based upon the level of such disability suffered by the individual, as determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Affirmative evidence of cause other than mother's service during Vietnam era.</I> No monetary allowance will be provided under this section based on a particular birth defect of an individual in any case where affirmative evidence establishes that the birth defect results from a cause other than the active military, naval, or air service of the individual's mother during the Vietnam era and, in determining the level of disability for an individual with more than one birth defect, the particular defect resulting from other causes will be excluded from consideration. This will not prevent VA from paying a monetary allowance under this section for other birth defects.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Nonduplication; spina bifida.</I> In the case of an individual whose only covered birth defect is spina bifida, a monetary allowance will be paid under &#xA7; 3.814, and not under this section, nor will the individual be evaluated for disability under this section. In the case of an individual who has spina bifida and one or more additional covered birth defects, a monetary allowance will be paid under this section and the amount of the monetary allowance will be not less than the amount the individual would receive if his or her only covered birth defect were spina bifida. If, but for the individual's one or more additional covered birth defects, the monetary allowance payable to or for the individual would be based on an evaluation at Level I, II, or III, respectively, under &#xA7; 3.814(d), the evaluation of the individual's level of disability under paragraph (e) of this section will be not less than Level II, III, or IV, respectively.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>No effect on other VA benefits.</I> Receipt of a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 will not affect the right of the individual, or the right of any person based on the individual's relationship to that person, to receive any other benefit to which the individual, or that person, may be entitled under any law administered by VA.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Definitions</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Vietnam veteran.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term <I>Vietnam veteran</I> means a person who performed active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to the characterization of the person's service. Service in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Individual.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term individual means a person, regardless of age or marital status, whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who was conceived after the date on which the veteran first entered the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975. Notwithstanding the provisions of &#xA7; 3.204(a)(1), VA will require the types of evidence specified in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.209 and 3.210 sufficient to establish that a person is the biological son or daughter of a Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Covered birth defect.</I> For the purposes of this section, the term <I>covered birth defect</I> means any birth defect identified by VA as a birth defect that is associated with the service of women Vietnam veterans in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, and that has resulted, or may result, in permanent physical or mental disability.

</P>
<P>(e) <I>Disability evaluations.</I> Whenever VA determines, upon receipt of competent medical evidence, that an individual has one or more covered birth defects, VA will determine the level of disability currently resulting, in combination, from the covered birth defects and associated disabilities. No monetary allowance will be payable under this section if VA determines under this paragraph that an individual has no current disability resulting from the covered birth defects, unless VA determines that the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section are for application. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, VA will determine the level of disability as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Levels of disability.</I>

</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Level II.</I> The individual meets one or more of the following criteria:
</P>

Subject to the condition that no benefits may be paid for any period prior to December 1, 2001:
</P>
<P>(1) VA will increase benefits as of the earliest date the evidence establishes that the level of severity increased, but only if the beneficiary applies for an increase within one year of that date.
</P>
<P>(2) If a claimant reopens a previously disallowed claim based on corrected military records, VA will award the benefit from the latest of the following dates: the date the veteran or beneficiary applied for a correction of the military records; the date the disallowed claim was filed; or, the date one year before the date of receipt of the reopened claim.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Reductions and discontinuances.</I> VA will generally reduce or discontinue awards under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 according to the facts found except as provided in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.105 and 3.114(b).
</P>
<P>(1) If benefits were paid erroneously because of beneficiary error, VA will reduce or discontinue benefits as of the effective date of the erroneous award.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.816 Awards under the Nehmer Court Orders for disability or death caused by a condition presumptively associated with herbicide exposure.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section states effective-date rules required by orders of a United States district court in the class-action case of <I>Nehmer</I> v. <I>United States Department of Veterans Affairs,</I> No. CV&#x2013;86&#x2013;6160 TEH (N.D. Cal.).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> For purposes of this section&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Nehmer class member</I> means:
</P>
<P>(i) A Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease; or
</P>
<P>(ii) A surviving spouse, child, or parent of a deceased Vietnam veteran who died from a covered herbicide disease.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Covered herbicide disease</I> means a disease for which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has established a presumption of service connection pursuant to the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102&#x2013;4, other than chloracne, as provided in &#xA7; 3.309(e).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Effective date of disability compensation.</I> If a <I>Nehmer</I> class member is entitled to disability compensation for a covered herbicide disease, the effective date of the award will be as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) If VA denied compensation for the same covered herbicide disease in a decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date VA received the claim on which the prior denial was based or the date the disability arose, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A prior decision will be construed as having denied compensation for the same disease if the prior decision denied compensation for a disease that reasonably may be construed as the same covered herbicide disease for which compensation has been awarded. Minor differences in the terminology used in the prior decision will not preclude a finding, based on the record at the time of the prior decision, that the prior decision denied compensation for the same covered herbicide disease.
</P>
<P>(2) If the class member's claim for disability compensation for the covered herbicide disease was either pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or was received by VA between that date and the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for the covered disease, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the disability arose, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A claim will be considered a claim for compensation for a particular covered herbicide disease if:
</P>
<P>(i) The claimant's application and other supporting statements and submissions may reasonably be viewed, under the standards ordinarily governing compensation claims, as indicating an intent to apply for compensation for the covered herbicide disability; or
</P>
<P>(ii) VA issued a decision on the claim, between May 3, 1989 and the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for the covered disease, in which VA denied compensation for a disease that reasonably may be construed as the same covered herbicide disease for which compensation has been awarded.
</P>
<P>(3) If the class member's claim referred to in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section was received within one year from the date of the class member's separation from service, the effective date of the award shall be the day following the date of the class member's separation from active service.
</P>
<P>(4) If the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section are not met, the effective date of the award shall be determined in accordance with &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.114 and 3.400.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Effective date of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC).</I> If a Nehmer class member is entitled to DIC for a death due to a covered herbicide disease, the effective date of the award will be as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) If VA denied DIC for the death in a decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date VA received the claim on which such prior denial was based or the date the death occurred, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) If the class member's claim for DIC for the death was either pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or was received by VA between that date and the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for the covered herbicide disease that caused the death, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the death occurred, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. In accordance with &#xA7; 3.152(b)(1), a claim by a surviving spouse or child for death pension will be considered a claim for DIC. In all other cases, a claim will be considered a claim for DIC if the claimant's application and other supporting statements and submissions may reasonably be viewed, under the standards ordinarily governing DIC claims, as indicating an intent to apply for DIC.
</P>
<P>(3) If the class member's claim referred to in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section was received within one year from the date of the veteran's death, the effective date of the award shall be the first day of the month in which the death occurred.
</P>
<P>(4) If the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section are not met, the effective date of the award shall be determined in accordance with &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.114 and 3.400.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Effect of other provisions affecting retroactive entitlement</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> If the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) or (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section are satisfied, the effective date shall be assigned as specified in those paragraphs, without regard to the provisions in 38 U.S.C. 5110(g) or &#xA7; 3.114 prohibiting payment for periods prior to the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for a covered herbicide disease. However, the provisions of this section will not apply if payment to a <I>Nehmer</I> class member based on a claim described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section is otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation, as, for example, where a class member did not qualify as a surviving spouse at the time of the prior claim or denial.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Claims Based on Service in the Republic of Vietnam Prior to August 5, 1964.</I> If a claim referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section was denied by VA prior to January 1, 1997, and the veteran's service in the Republic of Vietnam ended before August 5, 1964, the effective-date rules of this regulation do not apply. The effective date of benefits in such cases shall be determined in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5110. If a claim referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section was pending before VA on January 1, 1997, or was received by VA after that date, and the veteran's service in the Republic of Vietnam ended before August 5, 1964, the effective date shall be the later of the date provided by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section or January 1, 1997.

<P>(f) <I>Payment of Benefits to Survivors or Estates of Deceased Beneficiaries</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>General.</I> If a <I>Nehmer</I> class member entitled to retroactive benefits pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) or (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section dies prior to receiving payment of any such benefits, VA shall pay such unpaid retroactive benefits to the first individual or entity listed below that is in existence at the time of payment:
</P>
<P>(i) The class member's spouse, regardless of current marital status.
</P>
<NOTE>
<HED>Note to paragraph (<E T="01">f</E>)(1)(<E T="01">i</E>):</HED>
<P>For purposes of this paragraph, a spouse is the person who was legally married to the class member at the time of the class member's death.</P></NOTE>
<P>(ii) The class member's child(ren), regardless of age or marital status (if more than one child exists, payment will be made in equal shares, accompanied by an explanation of the division).
</P>
<NOTE>
<HED>Note to paragraph (<E T="01">f</E>)(1)(<E T="01">ii</E>):</HED>
<P>For purposes of this paragraph, the term &#x201C;child&#x201D; includes natural and adopted children, and also includes any stepchildren who were members of the class member's household at the time of the class member's death.</P></NOTE>
<P>(iii) The class member's parent(s), regardless of dependency (if both parents are alive, payment will be made in equal shares, accompanied by an explanation of the division).
</P>
<NOTE>
<HED>Note to paragraph (<E T="01">f</E>)(1)(<E T="01">iii</E>):</HED>
<P>For purposes of this paragraph, the term &#x201C;parent&#x201D; includes natural and adoptive parents, but in the event of successive parents, the persons who last stood as parents in relation to the class member will be considered the parents.</P></NOTE>
<P>(iv) The class member's estate.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Inapplicability of certain accrued benefit requirements.</I> The provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5121(c) and &#xA7; 3.1000(c) requiring survivors to file claims for accrued benefits do not apply to payments under this section. When a <I>Nehmer</I> class member dies prior to receiving retroactive payments under this section, VA will pay the amount to an identified payee in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section without requiring an application from the payee. Prior to releasing such payment, however, VA may ask the payee to provide further information as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Identifying payees.</I> VA shall make reasonable efforts to identify the appropriate payee(s) under paragraph (f)(1) of this section based on information in the veteran's claims file. If further information is needed to determine whether any appropriate payee exists or whether there are any persons having equal or higher precedence than a known prospective payee, VA will request such information from a survivor or authorized representative if the claims file provides sufficient contact information. Before releasing payment to an identified payee, VA will ask the payee to state whether there are any other survivors of the class member who may have equal or greater entitlement to payment under this section, unless the circumstances clearly indicate that such a request is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Bar to accrued benefit claims.</I> Payment of benefits pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall bar a later claim by any individual for payment of all or any part of such benefits as accrued benefits under 38 U.S.C. 5121 and &#xA7; 3.1000.

Such increased evaluations must be of an other than temporary nature (due to hospitalization, surgery, etc.).

<P>(5) In all other cases, only so much of the accrued benefit may be paid as may be necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial. (See &#xA7; 3.1002.)
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Apportionments.</I> (1) Upon the death of a person receiving an apportioned share of benefits payable to a veteran, all or any part of such unpaid amount is payable to the veteran or to any other dependent or dependents of the veteran.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.1010 Substitution under 38 U.S.C. 5121A following death of a claimant.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Eligibility.</I> If a claimant dies on or after October 10, 2008, a person eligible for accrued benefits under &#xA7; 3.1000(a) listed in 38 CFR 3.1000(a)(1) through (5) may, in priority order, request to substitute for the deceased claimant in a claim for periodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemembers' indemnity) under laws administered by the Secretary, or an appeal of a decision with respect to such a claim, that was pending before the agency of original jurisdiction or the Board of Veterans' Appeals when the claimant died. Upon VA's grant of a request to substitute, the substitute may continue the claim or appeal on behalf of the deceased claimant for purposes of processing the claim or appeal to completion. Any benefits ultimately awarded are payable to the substitute and other members of a joint class, if any, in equal shares.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Time and place for filing a request.</I> A person may not substitute for a deceased claimant under this section unless the person files a request to substitute with the agency of original jurisdiction no later than one year after the claimant's death.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Request format.</I> (1) A request to substitute must be submitted in writing. At a minimum, a request to substitute must indicate intent to substitute; include the deceased claimant's claim number, Social Security number, or appeal number; and include the names of the deceased claimant and the person requesting to substitute.
</P>
<P>(2) In lieu of a specific request to substitute, a claim for accrued benefits, survivors pension, or dependency and indemnity compensation by an eligible person listed in &#xA7; 3.1000(a)(1) through (5) is deemed to include a request to substitute if a claim for periodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemembers' indemnity) under laws administered by the Secretary, or an appeal of a decision with respect to such a claim, was pending before the agency of original jurisdiction or the Board of Veterans' Appeals when the claimant died. A claimant for accrued benefits, survivors pension, or dependency and indemnity compensation may waive the right to substitute in writing over the claimant's signature.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Evidence of eligibility.</I> A person filing a request to substitute must provide evidence of eligibility to substitute. Evidence of eligibility to substitute means evidence demonstrating that the person is among those listed in the categories of eligible persons in &#xA7; 3.1000(a)(1) through (5) and first in priority order. If a person's request to substitute does not include evidence of eligibility when it is originally submitted and the person may be an eligible person, the Secretary will notify the person&#x2014;
</P>
<P>(1) Of the evidence of eligibility required to complete the request to substitute;
</P>
<P>(2) That VA will take no further action on the request to substitute unless VA receives the evidence of eligibility; and
</P>
<P>(3) That VA must receive the evidence of eligibility no later than 60 days after the date of notification or one year after the claimant's death, whichever is later, or VA will deny the request to substitute.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Decisions on substitution requests.</I> Subject to the provisions of &#xA7; 20.1302 of this chapter, the agency of original jurisdiction will decide in the first instance all requests to substitute, including any request to substitute in an appeal pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Notification.</I> The agency of original jurisdiction will provide written notification of the granting or denial of a request to substitute to the person who filed the request, together with notice in accordance with &#xA7; 3.103(b)(1).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Appeals.</I> The denial of a request to substitute may be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 7104(a) and 7105.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Joint class representative.</I> (i) A <I>joint class</I> means a group of two or more persons eligible to substitute under the same priority group under &#xA7; 3.1000(a)(1) through (a)(5), e.g., two or more surviving children.
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case of a joint class of potential substitutes, only one person of the joint class may be a substitute at any one time. The first eligible person in the joint class to file a request to substitute will be the substitute representing the joint class.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Adjudications involving a substitute.</I> The following provisions apply with respect to a claim or appeal in which a survivor has been substituted for the deceased claimant:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Notice under</I> &#xA7; <I>3.159.</I> VA will send notice under &#xA7; 3.159(b), &#x201C;Department of Veterans Affairs assistance in developing claims,&#x201D; to the substitute only if the required notice was not sent to the deceased claimant or if the notice sent to the deceased claimant was inadequate.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Expansion of the claim not permitted.</I> A substitute may not add an issue to or expand the claim. However, a substitute may raise new theories of entitlement in support of the claim.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Submission of evidence and other rights.</I> A substitute has the same rights regarding hearings, representation, appeals, and the submission of evidence as would have applied to the claimant had the claimant not died. However, rights that may have applied to the claimant prior to death but which cannot practically apply to a substitute, such as the right to a medical examination, are not available to the substitute. The substitute must complete any action required by law or regulation within the time period remaining for the claimant to take such action on the date of his or her death. The time remaining to take such action will start to run on the date of the mailing of the decision granting the substitution request.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Board of Veterans' Appeals procedures.</I> The rules and procedures governing appeals involving substitutes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals are found in parts 19 and 20 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Limitations on substitution.</I> The following limitations apply with respect to substitution:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>A claim or appeal must be pending.</I> (i) A claim is considered to be pending if the claimant had filed the claim with an agency of original jurisdiction but dies before the agency of original jurisdiction makes a decision on the claim. A claim is also considered to be pending if, at the time of the claimant's death, the agency of original jurisdiction has made a decision on the claim, but the claimant has not filed a notice of disagreement, and the period allowed by law for filing a notice of disagreement has not expired.
</P>
<P>(ii) An appeal is considered to be pending if a claimant filed a notice of disagreement in response to a notification from an agency of original jurisdiction of its decision on a claim, but dies before the Board of Veterans' Appeals issues a final decision on the appeal. If the Board issued a final decision on an appeal prior to the claimant's death, the appeal is not pending before VA for purposes of this section, even if the 120-day period for appealing the Board's decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has not yet expired.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Benefits awarded.</I> Any benefits ultimately awarded are limited to any past-due benefits for the time period between the effective date of the award and what would have been the effective date of discontinuance of the award as a result of the claimant's death.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Benefits for last sickness and burial only.</I> When substitution cannot be established under any of the categories listed in &#xA7; 3.1000(a)(1) through (a)(4), only so much of any benefits ultimately awarded may be paid as may be necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness and burial. No part of any benefits ultimately awarded shall be used to reimburse any political subdivision of the United States for expenses incurred in the last sickness or burial of any claimant.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Substitution by subordinate members prohibited.</I> Failure to timely file a request to substitute, or a waiver of the right to request substitution, by a person of a preferred category of eligible person will not serve to vest the right to request substitution in a person in a lower category or a person who bore the expense of last sickness and burial; neither will such failure or waiver by a person or persons in a joint class serve to increase the amount payable to other persons in the class.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Death of a substitute.</I> If a substitute dies while a claim or appeal is pending before an agency of original jurisdiction, or an appeal of a decision on a claim is pending before the Board, another member of the same joint class or a member of the next preferred subordinate category listed in &#xA7; 3.1000(a)(1) through (5) may substitute for the deceased substitute but only if the person requesting the successive substitution files a request to substitute no later than one year after the date of the substitute's death (not the date of the claimant's death).

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.1702 Persons who may receive burial benefits; priority of payments.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Automatic payments to surviving spouses of eligible deceased veterans.</I> (1) On or after July 7, 2014, VA may automatically pay a burial benefit to an eligible veteran's surviving spouse, whether or not previously established as a dependent spouse on the deceased veteran's compensation or pension award, when VA knows of or is informed of the existence of the surviving spouse, can establish the surviving spouse's relationship under &#xA7; 3.204 (when applicable), and is able to determine burial benefits eligibility based on evidence of record at the time VA updates its computer system to reflect the veteran's date of death.
</P>
<P>(2) VA may grant additional burial benefits, including the plot or interment allowance, reimbursement for transportation, and the service-connected burial allowance under &#xA7; 3.1704, to the surviving spouse or any other eligible person in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and based on a claim described in &#xA7; 3.1703.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Priority of payments&#x2014;claims received on or after July 7, 2014.</I> (1) Except for claims a State, or an agency or political subdivision of a State, files under &#xA7; 3.1707, Plot or interment allowance for burial in a State veterans cemetery or other cemetery, or &#xA7; 3.1708, Burial of a veteran whose remains are unclaimed, VA will pay, upon the death of a veteran, the first living person to file of those listed below:

<P>(i) His or her surviving spouse;
</P>
<P>(ii) The survivor of a legal union between the deceased veteran and the survivor that is not covered by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, <I>legal union</I> means a formal relationship between the decedent and the survivor that

<P>(A) Existed on the date of the veteran's death,
</P>
<P>(B) Was recognized under the law of the State in which the couple formalized the relationship, and

<P>(C) Was evidenced by the State's issuance of documentation memorializing the relationship;
</P>
<P>(iii) His or her children, regardless of age;
</P>
<P>(iv) His or her parents or the surviving parent; or
</P>
<P>(v) The executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased veteran. If no executor or administrator has been appointed, VA may pay burial benefits based on a claim filed by a person acting for such estate who will distribute the burial benefits to the person or persons entitled to such distribution under the laws of the veteran's last State of residence.
</P>
<P>(2) In the case of a veteran whose remains are unclaimed, VA will pay the person or entity that provided burial services and transportation subject to the limitations prescribed in &#xA7;&#xA7; 3.1708 and 3.1709.
</P>
<P>(3) VA will pay burial benefits to a single representative of the categories in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. VA will not divide applicable burial benefits among claimants; it is the responsibility of the recipient to distribute benefits as may be required.
</P>
<P>(c) Priority of payments&#x2014;claims received before July 7, 2014.
</P>
<P>(1) Claims for burial allowance may be executed by:

</P>
<P>(ii) The individual whose personal funds were used to pay burial, funeral, and transportation expenses; or
</P>
<P>(iii) The executor or administrator of the estate of the veteran or the estate of the person who paid the expenses of the veteran's burial or provided such services. If no executor or administrator has been appointed then by some person acting for such estate who will make distribution of the burial allowance to the person or persons entitled under the laws governing the distribution of interstate estates in the State of the decedent's personal domicile.
</P>
<P>(2) Claims for the plot or interment allowance (except for claims filed by a State or an agency or political subdivision thereof), under &#xA7; 3.1707 may be executed by:
</P>
<P>(i) The funeral director, if he or she provided the plot or interment services, or advanced funds to pay for them, and if the entire bill for such or any balance thereof is unpaid (if the unpaid bill or the unpaid balance is less than the statutory plot or interment allowance, only the unpaid amount may be claimed by the funeral director); or
</P>
<P>(ii) The person(s) whose personal funds were used to defray the cost of the plot or interment expenses; or
</P>
<P>(iii) The person or entity from whom the plot was purchased or who provided interment services if the bill for such is unpaid in whole or in part.

Any remaining balance of the plot or interment allowance may then be applied to interment expenses; or
</P>
<P>(iv) The executor or administrator of the estate of the veteran or the estate of the person who bore the expense of the plot or interment expenses. If no executor or administrator has been appointed, claim for the plot or interment allowance may be filed as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section for the burial allowance.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.1706 Burial allowance for a veteran who died while hospitalized by VA.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General rule.</I> VA will pay up to the maximum burial allowance specified in 38 U.S.C. 2303(a) for the burial and funeral expenses of a veteran described in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Eligibility.</I> A burial allowance is payable under this section for a veteran whose death was not service-connected and who died while hospitalized by VA. For purposes of this allowance, a veteran was hospitalized by VA if the veteran:
</P>
<P>(1) Was properly admitted to a VA facility (as described in 38 U.S.C. 1701(3)) for hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1710 or 1711(a);
</P>
<P>(2) Was transferred or admitted to a non-VA facility (as described in 38 U.S.C. 1701(4)) for hospital care under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1703;
</P>
<P>(3) Was transferred or admitted to a nursing home for nursing home care at the expense of the U.S. under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1720;

</P>
<P>(6) Was hospitalized by VA pursuant to any of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section but was not at the facility at the time of death and was:
</P>
<P>(i) On authorized absence that did not exceed 96 hours at the time of death;
</P>
<P>(ii) On unauthorized absence for a period not in excess of 24 hours at the time of death; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Absent from the facility for a period not in excess of 24 hours of combined authorized and unauthorized absence at the time of death.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Hospitalization in the Philippines.</I> Hospitalization in the Philippines under 38 U.S.C. 1731, 1732, and 1733 does not meet the requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Additional allowances available based on death while hospitalized by VA.</I> In addition to the burial allowance authorized by this section:
</P>
<P>(1) VA will reimburse for the expense of transporting the remains of a person described in paragraph (b) of this section to the place of burial subject to the limitations of &#xA7; 3.1709 and where the death occurs within a State and:
</P>
<P>(i) The place of burial is in the same State or any other State; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The place of burial is in Canada or Mexico. However, reimbursement for transportation of the remains for such burial is authorized only from the place of death within a State to the port of embarkation within a State, or to the border limits of the United States.
</P>
<P>(2) VA may pay the plot or interment allowance for burial in a veterans cemetery under &#xA7; 3.1707, Plot or interment allowance.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.1707 Plot or interment allowances for burial in a State veterans cemetery or other cemetery.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General eligibility.</I> For a veteran who was eligible for burial in a national cemetery under 38 U.S.C. 2402, but was not buried in a national cemetery or other cemetery under the jurisdiction of the U.S., VA will pay the allowances described below, provided all criteria are met.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Plot or interment allowance for burial in a State veterans cemetery.</I> VA will pay the plot or interment allowance in the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 2303(b)(1) (without regard to whether any other burial benefits were provided for that veteran) to a State, or an agency or political subdivision of a State, that provided a burial plot or interment for the veteran without charge if the State, or agency or political subdivision of the State:
</P>
<P>(1) Is claiming the plot or interment allowance for burial of the veteran in a cemetery, or section of a cemetery, owned by the State or agency or subdivision of the State;
</P>
<P>(2) Did not charge for the expense of the plot or interment; and
</P>
<P>(3) Uses the cemetery or section of a cemetery solely for the interment of:
</P>
<P>(i) Persons eligible for burial in a national cemetery; and
</P>
<P>(ii) In a claim based on a veteran's death after October 31, 2000, either:
</P>
<P>(A) Deceased members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces not otherwise eligible for interment in a national cemetery; or
</P>
<P>(B) Deceased former members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces not otherwise eligible for interment in a national cemetery who were discharged or released from service under conditions other than dishonorable.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Plot or interment allowance payable based on burial in other than a State veterans cemetery.</I> Unless VA has evidence on the date it receives notice of the veteran's death that the expenses incurred were less, VA will pay the maximum plot or interment allowance specified in 38 U.S.C. 2303(b)(2) to a claimant who incurred plot or interment expenses relating to the purchase of a burial plot for a deceased veteran if the veteran is buried in a cemetery other than a cemetery described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section and:
</P>
<P>(1) The veteran is eligible for a burial allowance under &#xA7; 3.1705, Burial allowance based on non-service-connected death;
</P>
<P>(2) The veteran is eligible for a burial allowance under &#xA7; 3.1706, Burial allowance for a veteran who died while hospitalized by VA;
</P>
<P>(3) The veteran was discharged from active service for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty (VA will accept the official service record of such discharge as proof of eligibility for the plot or interment allowance and VA will disregard any previous VA determination made in connection with a claim for monetary benefits that the disability was not incurred or aggravated in line of duty); or
</P>
<P>(4) The veteran, at the time of discharge from active service, had a disability, shown by official service records, which in medical judgment would have justified a discharge for disability.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Definitions.</I> For purposes of subpart B of this part, <I>plot</I> or <I>burial plot</I> means the final disposal site of the remains, whether it is a grave, mausoleum vault, columbarium niche, or other similar place. <I>Plot or interment expenses</I> are those expenses associated with the final disposition of the remains and are not confined to the acts done within the burial grounds but may include the removal of remains for burial or interment.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.2500 Review of decisions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Reviews available.</I> (1) Within one year from the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue as defined in &#xA7; 3.151(c), except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), (e), and (f) of this section, a claimant may elect one of the following administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary:

<P>(i) A request for higher-level review under &#xA7; 3.2601 or
</P>
<P>(ii) An appeal to the Board under &#xA7; 20.202 of this chapter.

<P>(2) At any time after VA issues notice of a decision on an issue within a claim, a claimant may file a supplemental claim under &#xA7; 3.2501.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Concurrent election prohibited.</I> With regard to the adjudication of a claim or an issue as defined in &#xA7; 3.151(c), a claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option. While the adjudication of a specific benefit is pending on appeal before a federal court, a claimant may not file for administrative review of the claim under any of options listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Continuously pursued issues.</I> A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, as specified (except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), (e), and (f) of this section), after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, Board of Veterans' Appeals, or by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is timely filed as determined by the court:
</P>
<P>(1) Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.
</P>
<P>(2) Following notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. (See appeal to the Board, 38 CFR 20.202).
</P>
<P>(3) Following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
</P>
<P>(4) Following a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Voluntary withdrawal.</I> A claimant may withdraw a supplemental claim or a request for a higher-level review at any time before VA renders a decision on the issue. A claimant must submit in writing or through electronic submission in a manner prescribed by the Secretary any notice of withdrawal of an issue under the selected review option to the agency of original jurisdiction. The withdrawal will be effective the date VA receives it. A claimant may withdraw an appeal to the Board of Veteran's Appeals as prescribed in &#xA7; 20.205.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Changing review options while a review is pending adjudication</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Within one year of prior decision notice.</I> A claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the request as prescribed in &#xA7; 3.2500(d) and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>More than one year after notice of a decision.</I> A claimant may change the review option selected to a supplemental claim after expiration of one-year following the date on which VA issued a notice of decision on an issue by following the procedure specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Where VA receives the supplemental claim application after expiration of the one-year period, continuous pursuit of the claim will be broken and VA will apply the effective date provisions under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, unless VA grants an extension of the one-year period for good cause shown under &#xA7; 3.109(b) and the supplemental claim application is received within the extension period allowed.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Applicability.</I> This section applies to claims and requests under the modernized review system as set forth in &#xA7; 3.2400, with the exception that a supplemental claim may not be filed in connection with a denial of a request to revise a final decision of the agency of original jurisdiction based on clear and unmistakable error.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Review of simultaneously contested claims.</I> Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, a party to a simultaneously contested claim may only seek administrative review of a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction on such claim by filing an appeal to the Board as prescribed in &#xA7; 20.402 of this chapter within 60 days of the date VA issues notice of the decision on the claim.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.2501 Supplemental claims.</HEAD>
<P>Except as otherwise provided, a claimant or his or her authorized representative, if any, who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim (see &#xA7; 3.1(p)(2)) by submitting in writing or electronically a complete application (see &#xA7; 3.160(a)) on a form prescribed by the Secretary any time after the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending (see <I>&#xA7; </I>3.160(c)) or has become finally adjudicated (see <I>&#xA7; </I>3.160(d)). If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the agency of original jurisdiction will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the agency of original jurisdiction will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim. In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed (see 3.103(c)).
</P>
<P>(a) <I>New and relevant evidence.</I> The new and relevant standard will not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under &#xA7; 3.156(a).
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Definition.</I> New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Receipt prior to notice of a decision.</I> New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Evidentiary record.</I> The evidentiary record for a supplemental claim includes all evidence received by VA before VA issues notice of a decision on the supplemental claim. For VA to readjudicate the claim, the evidentiary record must include new and relevant evidence that was not of record as of the date of notice of the prior decision.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Duty to assist.</I> Upon receipt of a substantially complete supplemental claim, VA's duty to assist in the gathering of evidence under &#xA7; 3.159 of this part is triggered and includes any such assistance that may help secure new and relevant evidence as defined in paragraph (a) of this section to complete the supplemental claim application.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Date of filing.</I> The filing date of a supplemental claim is determined according to &#xA7; 3.155, with the exception of the intent to file rule found in &#xA7; 3.155(b) which applies to initial claims.

In readjudicating the claim, the agency of original jurisidction will correct all identified duty to assist errors, complete a new decision and issue notice to the claimant and or his or her legal representative in accordance with 3.103(f).

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.2600 Legacy review of benefit claims decisions.</HEAD>
<P>This section applies only to legacy claims as defined in &#xA7; 3.2400 in which a Notice of Disagreement is timely filed on or after June 1, 2001, under regulations applicable at the time of filing.
</P>
<P>(a) A claimant who has filed a Notice of Disagreement submitted in accordance with the provisions of &#xA7; 20.201 of this chapter, and either &#xA7; 20.302(a) or &#xA7; 20.501(a) of this chapter, as applicable, with a decision of an agency of original jurisdiction on a benefit claim has a right to a review of that decision under this section. The review will be conducted by a Veterans Service Center Manager, Pension Management Center Manager, or Decision Review Officer, at VA's discretion. An individual who did not participate in the decision being reviewed will conduct this review. Only a decision that has not yet become final (by appellate decision or failure to timely appeal) may be reviewed. Review under this section will encompass only decisions with which the claimant has expressed disagreement in the Notice of Disagreement. The reviewer will consider all evidence of record and applicable law, and will give no deference to the decision being reviewed.
</P>
<P>(b) Unless the claimant has requested review under this section with his or her Notice of Disagreement, VA will, upon receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, notify the claimant in writing of his or her right to a review under this section. To obtain such a review, the claimant must request it not later than 60 days after the date VA mails the notice. This 60-day time limit may not be extended. If the claimant fails to request review under this section not later than 60 days after the date VA mails the notice, VA will proceed with the traditional appellate process by issuing a Statement of the Case. A claimant may not have more than one review under this section of the same decision.
</P>
<P>(c) The reviewer may conduct whatever development he or she considers necessary to resolve any disagreements in the Notice of Disagreement, consistent with applicable law. This may include an attempt to obtain additional evidence or the holding of an informal conference with the claimant. Upon the request of the claimant, the reviewer will conduct a hearing under the version of &#xA7; 3.103(c) of this chapter predating Public Law 115&#x2013;55.
</P>
<P>(d) The reviewer may grant a benefit sought in the claim notwithstanding &#xA7; 3.105(b), but, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, may not revise the decision in a manner that is less advantageous to the claimant than the decision under review. A review decision made under this section will include a summary of the evidence, a citation to pertinent laws, a discussion of how those laws affect the decision, and a summary of the reasons for the decision.
</P>
<P>(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the reviewer may reverse or revise (even if disadvantageous to the claimant) prior decisions of an agency of original jurisdiction (including the decision being reviewed or any prior decision that has become final due to failure to timely appeal) on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error (see &#xA7; 3.105(a)).
</P>
<P>(f) Review under this section does not limit the appeal rights of a claimant. Unless a claimant withdraws his or her Notice of Disagreement as a result of this review process, VA will proceed with the traditional appellate process by issuing a Statement of the Case.

<HEAD>&#xA7; 3.2601 Higher-level review.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Applicability.</I> This section applies to all claims under the modernized review system, with the exception of simultaneously contested claims.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Requirements for election.</I> A claimant who is dissatisfied with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction may file a request for higher-level review in accordance with &#xA7; 3.2500, by submitting a complete request for review on a form prescribed by the Secretary.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Complete request.</I> A complete request for higher-level review is a submission of a request on a form prescribed by the Secretary, whether paper or electronic, that meets the following requirements:
</P>
<P>(1) A complete request must provide the name of the claimant and the relationship to the veteran, if applicable;
</P>
<P>(2) A complete request must be signed by the claimant or a person legally authorized to sign for the claimant; and
</P>
<P>(3) A complete request must specify the date of the underlying decision for which review is requested and specify the issues for which review is requested.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Filing period.</I> A complete request for higher-level review must be received by VA within one year of the date of VA's issuance of the notice of the decision. If VA receives an incomplete request form, VA will notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the request form prescribed by the Secretary. If a complete request is submitted within 60 days of the date of the VA notification of such incomplete request or prior to the expiration of the one-year filing period, VA will consider it filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form that did not meet the standards of a complete request.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Who may conduct a higher-level review.</I> Higher-level review will be conducted by an experienced adjudicator who did not participate in the prior decision. Selection of a higher-level adjudicator to conduct a higher-level review is at VA's discretion. As a general rule, an adjudicator in an office other than the office that rendered the prior decision will conduct the higher-level review. An exception to this rule applies for claims requiring specialized processing, such as where there is only one office that handles adjudication of a particular type of entitlement. A claimant may request that the office that rendered the prior decision conduct the higher-level review, and VA will grant the request in the absence of good cause to deny such as when processing is centralized at one office within the agency of original jurisdiction or when the office that rendered the prior decision does not have higher-level review personnel available to conduct the review.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Evidentiary record.</I> The evidentiary record in a higher-level review is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the agency of original jurisdiction issued notice of the prior decision under review and the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence. The higher-level adjudicator may not order development of additional evidence that may be relevant to the claim under review, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Duty to assist errors.</I> The higher-level adjudicator will ensure that VA complied with its statutory duty to assist (see &#xA7; 3.159) in gathering evidence applicable prior to issuance of the decision being reviewed. If the higher-level adjudicator both identifies a duty to assist error that existed at the time of VA's decision on the claim under review and cannot grant the maximum benefit for the claim, the higher-level adjudicator must return the claim for correction of the error and readjudication. Upon receipt, the agency of jurisdiction will expeditiously readjudicate the claim in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5109B.
</P>
<P>(1) For disability evaluations, the <I>maximum benefit</I> means the highest schedular evaluation allowed by law and regulation for the issue under review.
</P>
<P>(2) For ancillary benefits, the <I>maximum benefit</I> means the granting of the benefit sought.
</P>
<P>(3) For pension benefits or dependents indemnity compensation, the <I>maximum benefit</I> means granting the highest benefit payable.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Informal conferences.</I> A claimant or his or her representative may include a request for an informal conference with a request for higher-level review. For purposes of this section, <I>informal conference</I> means contact with a claimant's representative or, if not represented, with the claimant, telephonically, or as otherwise determined by VA, for the sole purpose of allowing the claimant or representative to identify any errors of law or fact in a prior decision based on the record at the time the decision was issued. If requested, VA will make reasonable efforts to contact the claimant and/or the authorized representative to conduct one informal conference during a higher-level review, but if such reasonable efforts are not successful, a decision may be issued in the absence of an informal conference. The higher-level adjudicator with determinative authority over the issue will conduct the informal conference, absent exceptional circumstances. VA will not receive any new evidence or introduction of facts not present at the time of the prior decision or apart of the evidentiary record in support of the higher-level review during the informal conference in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Any expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with the informal conference are the responsibility of the claimant.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>De novo review.</I> The higher-level adjudicator will consider only those decisions and claims for which the claimant has requested higher-level review, and will conduct a de novo review giving no deference to the prior decision, except as provided in &#xA7; 3.104(c).
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Difference of opinion.</I> The higher-level adjudicator may grant a benefit sought in the claim under review based on a difference of opinion (see &#xA7; 3.105(b)). However, any finding favorable to the claimant is binding except as provided in &#xA7; 3.104(c) of this part. In addition, the higher-level adjudicator will not revise the outcome in a manner that is less advantageous to the claimant based solely on a difference of opinion. The higher-level adjudicator may reverse or revise (even if disadvantageous to the claimant) prior decisions by VA (including the decision being reviewed or any prior decision) on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error under &#xA7; 3.105(a)(1) or (a)(2), as applicable, depending on whether the prior decision is finally adjudicated.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Notice requirements.</I> Notice of a decision made under this section will include all of the elements described in &#xA7; 3.103(f), a general statement indicating whether evidence submitted while the record was closed was not considered, and notice of the options available to have such evidence considered.
